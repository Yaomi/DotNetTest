00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,396
and started blowing whistles many times''

176
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:53,195
''You are the first flower
which blossomed inside me''

177
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:58,534
''lf you give consent won't l tie
the knot and take you away''

178
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,673
''On the bank of Aluva river,

179
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,279
when there was no one,

180
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:13,356
''Slipping slowly,
December breeze came searching''

181
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,485
Get lost!!

182
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,269
Just after this turn, it's her house!

183
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,863
Go and give her the letter boldly!

184
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,636
This isjust a simple matter!

185
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,209
What's that sound?

186
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,471
Sounds like someone is coming running!

187
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,783
Why is he running?
Any dog chasing him?

188
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,377
Dog chased our Kolakozhi!

189
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,685
Get away...her dad....

190
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,388

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,881
Run and save yourself!

192
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,090
Dude, he fell!! Kolakozhi fell!

193
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,254
Bro, Move...move...l say move...

194
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:57,701
Heck with your letter!

195
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,500
Kolakozhi: l swear, it was him.

196
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,278
Oh God, he caught our Kolakozhi!

197
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:10,907
Pedal it fast, man

198
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,251
-George: Cling onto me tightly, Koya
- Koya: l will never leave even if l die.

199
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,380
Shambu must have reached the
next district!

200
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,915
Koya: Your damn letter and Love!

201
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,258
Koya: Looks like Kolakozhi
has fallen into water.

202
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:21,618
Koya: Bro, pedal fast,
or else we'll also fall into the water.

203
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,261
George: Move away, fatso..move!

204
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,122
Kuttapi! l think your friend
is pushed into the water.

205
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,730
Kuttapi: Kolakozhi!
l think he's dead!

206
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:30,768
Koya: Shit! ls it a Puncture?

207
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:10,534
Hello!

208
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,438
Koya there?

209
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:19,807
Mom, keep down the receiver.

210
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,943
Who's this?

211
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,644
lt's me, George!

212
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,616
Oh you! Tell me!

213
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,292
l'm going to call her home now!
What is your opinion?

214
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,290
Bro, have you so soon forgotten,
Shambu slipped from the bicycle,

215
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,929
And, that fellow was chasing and hitting him,
didn't you see?

216
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,298
Hmm! Why don't you encourage me
like earlier?

217
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,695
lt's not because, l don't love you.

218
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,498
l'm scared! l am really scared of him!

219
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,367
Let me tell you another matter!

220
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,301
What's it?

221
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,435
What bullshit have you
written in that letter?

222
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,704
Mary looks like Sardine fry!

223
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,640
What look is that!!

224
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,679
Have l written like that?

225
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:52,882
Yes! You've written it like that!

226
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,679
Oh my God! Afisher woman had been
to my house at that time. Damn!!

227
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,544
Shucks! lt's because of that!

228
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:59,655
Then, write, ,AoFisher woman's' looks!

229
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:00,650
There are some more...

230
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,224
She's your Vaariyellu (Backbone)!

231
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,655
By the by, what's this Greek mythology?

232
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,558
This question is what l expect from her!

233
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,359
When l give her this letter,
she'll ask me what Greek Mythology is!

234
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,559
And l can explain to her
what Greek Mythology is, right?

235
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,930
lf you get caught in his hand...

236
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,499
he will tear your mythology apart!

237
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,799
Hey dude! What?

238
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:16,899
Go ahead!

239
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,675
What if l write a letter
to her in English?

240
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:23,872
ls it really needed?

241
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:26,818
No..No..Not needed, right?

242
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,652
And about calling her,
you ask Shambu also!

243
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,051
Okay, bye, good night!

244
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:34,985

When mosquito bit, l beat it

274
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:46,581
Hmm....Mosquito!!

275
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,458

00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,855
Someone will surely pick!

279
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,972
Last night, when l was
about to read that magazine...

280

Ah, George! Mary,
When you leave, after class,

312
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,264
Shut up and Don't tell her

313
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,040
Cover the receiver!

314
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,107
Or, tell her l'm also glamorous.

315
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,542
Hello! Shall l meet you
over Aqueduct bridge tomorrow?

316
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,840
No..Not necessary.

317
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:53,776
What happened?

318
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,752
Not necessary, it seems.

319
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,912
Eh!! - NOT NECESSARY

320
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,157
That means...

321
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,023
the same - maybe not necessary!

322
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:04,821
Maybe she meant,
not to come and see her.

323
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,821
That's what l also said, right?

324
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,158
Anyway, l am not coming tomorrow.
You go!

325
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,968
-Dude! An idea!! - What?

326
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,541
Her dad's name is George,

327
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:17,572
and my name is also George.

328
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,641
Can't l say there's no need
for herto change her surname?

329
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,937
Fantastic idea!

330
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:22,976
-Koya: But you must tell this to her.
-George: l'll tell

331
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,576
-Why do l've to fear?
- ay boldly!

332

333
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,616
Say it quickly before her dad arrives.

334
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,616
Shambu, Have an eye at the front
and l'll take care of the backside.

335
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,314
Who's this in yellow shirt?

336
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,250
Sis! ls he taking part
in a Fancy dress show?

337
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,754
-That big house in Ras al-Khaimah..
- Okay!

338
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,595
Who the hell is he?

339
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,870
Papa - who prefers business as the
most important thing in life.

340
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,604
And Mom - is always
busy with night party and dance.

341
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,367
My only friends..

342
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,300
were the Arab friends
in Sharjah boarding school.

343
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,770
-Don't you have any sisters?
- No.

344
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,611
That Prince was living alone
in that big house.

345
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,715
Which Prince, bro?

346
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:01,852
You shut up, boy!

347
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,359
What is he saying? Arabic, huh?

348
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,359
Bro, please give way.

349
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:19,768
See, a Sachin Tendulkar behind you!

350
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,403
Hey, you ogler?.
ls that you - Girirajan Kozhi(Flirt)

351
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,036
Jojo!

352
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,807
ls this your usual business?

353
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,710
From where did you spring up, you demon?

354
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,378
l'm going to play Cricket. Give way.

355
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,974
Then, carry on with your Cricket. Go!

356
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,177
Go...and hit six!

357
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:35,750
Hey George... l've a tournament
at St.Mary's. Let me go.

358
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:36,852
Hey, bat.

359
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:38,914
Where did l stop?

360
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,192
When l was playing
football in Sharjah Cricket stadium,

361
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,319
my Arab friends asked me..

362
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,326
and my childhood was taken aback!

363
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:50,963
Yes, certainly!

364
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,403
Without love, sadly, l stood waiting..

365
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,134
And, thus started running for it.

366
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,209
Run...run..

367
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,432
At last, l found you!

368
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:00,870
Jancy...

369
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:03,403
Jancy? Oh sorry!

370
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:04,271
l love you.

371
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:05,279
Koya, come quickly..

372
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,712
Dude, tell me,
when you're about to run!

373
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:08,351
Who are you?

374
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,050
Who are you?

375
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:11,746
Who are you, man?

376
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,753
Exactly what l meant, who are you?

377
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:16,391
Who are these vagabonds
coming this way?

378
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:17,160
Who are you?

379
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,429
Why did you take off my glasses?

380
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,396
Why you removed?

381
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:20,390
Who are you?

382
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,733
Who are you, man?

383
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,195
l....l'm going to play cricket.

384
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,765
Who are you to ask me all this?

385
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,901
Did you only get my daughter
to play cricket with?

386
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,134
Aah (weeping), he hit me....

387
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:32,773
l understood one thing today.

388
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:34,911
Never ever trust you guys!

389
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:35,772
Why?

390
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,345
When that bull dog arrived,
you guys left me there and fled.

391
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,013
Do l've to say all this?
Don't you've sense to run?

392
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,184
Hey, l didn't notice him.

393
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:42,943
You must notice!

394
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:44,720
What a misfortune!

395
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,187
When l'd been there
with the letter forthe 1st time,

396
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:46,982
that Kolakozhi guy was there.

397
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,393
And today, who was that
yellow shirt Arabic guy?

398
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,394
Who the hell is he?

399
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,122
Fortunately, he was there!

400
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,197
Otherwise, we would've been
in deep trouble.

401
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,457
We would've been beaten up black
and blue if he wasn't there.

402
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,429
Oh!! Never!

403
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:00,203
l don't understand one thing though.

404
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,135
Why is it that all the
guys are after her?

405
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,408
Don't say that.

406
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,744
Hey, she's beautiful!

407
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,809
Really. Come on,
her hair resembles like a beehive!

408
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,009
She is beautiful?!

409
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,046
Dude! An idea!

410
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,318
Why don't we coax the
newspaper boy of her house?

411
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:19,186
And in between the newspaper..
let's keep a card, letter and a rose flower..

412
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,458
Keep a flower pot too..

413
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,189
What if it falls into the
hands of that bull dog(Mary's father)?

414
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,986
l see!!

415
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,790
Oh God!! Nothing is happening!

416
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,326
George, you please talk softly.

417
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,000
Everyone is here except mom.

418
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,074
Don't simply object every idea ...
Suggest some good idea.

419
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,366
To whom else can he say all this?

420
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,170
He has only us, right?

421
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,141
So, think well!

422
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,039
Give me a puff.

423
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,549
Koya: l'm thinking!

424
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,886
Yes, l got an idea!

425
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,223
Stop!

426
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,350
-Coming...Coming.
- Run...Run..

427
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,416
Who kept these benches here?

428
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:56,823
What are you guys up to?

429
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,825
You guys are going to
smash the shop!

430
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,532
lt was you, who let them in!
So, you throw all of them out.

431
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:02,834
That's enough!
Go and prepare tea!

432
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,035
Bye....Bye..

433
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,533
That ogler got enough!

434
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,044
Mary, your dad punched my eye red!

435
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,849
Mary, l want to tell you something.

436
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:18,845
About what?

437
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,548
No, l'll tell it to Mary.

438
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,546
Mary, why don't you ask him
what it's about?

439
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,342
l'll help you.

440
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,351
No thanks. Mary is in 12th grade now,
she can help herself!

441
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,024
l would like to tell you..

442
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,453
Mary, the cycle tyre
seems to have low air..

443
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,350
Don't worry.
We'll fill it on the way

444
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,029
Mary...

445
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,031
.. l would like to tell you something.

446
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:34,459
Hmm..come on.

447
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,026
Mary, let's go home.
We need to do our homework.

448
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,031
Give way. Let her take her cycle.

449
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,567
The road is too steep,
l'll help you out.

450
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:41,361
Sorry da!

451
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,036
l can help you if you need.

452
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,802
You take your cycle.

453
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,542
''l go to see her regularly''

454
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,284
''l see her without missing a day''

455
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,044
He asked me to talk to her
in front of him!

456
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,050
Who the hell does he think he is!
l'll push him down from the bridge.

457
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,551
''l can't hold without telling,
there's fire in my heart''

458
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,202
''l go to see her regularly''

459
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,201
''l see her without missing a day''

460
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,205
''lt is a pain which l hid in
my heart for many days''

461
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,311
''l can't hold without telling,
there's fire in my heart''

462
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,480
You said,
her dad is not at home..

463
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,480
-When did l say?
- Run..!

464
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:27,379
Who closed the gate?

465
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:28,483
Not me..Must be Shambu!

466
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,655
Before her dad sees us,
take the cycle and run.

467
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,460
''The eyes with moving waves
are Oleander flowers''

468
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,359
''They are like blossomed
cupid flowers''

469
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,195
''She is like gold melted
in sweet seventeen''

470
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:49,032
''She is a girl like a
rainbow which is painted''

471
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,209
''The eyes with moving waves
are Oleander flowers''

472
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:52,671
WHAT?

473
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,477
''They are like blossomed
cupid flowers''

474
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,476
Get lost, you Ogler!

475
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,173
''She is like gold melted
in sweet seventeen''

476
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:03,650
''She is a girl like a
rainbow which is painted''

477
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,028
A cracker burst overthere!

478
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,675
''l go to see her regularly

479
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:28,576
''l see her without missing a day''

480
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,208
''lt is a pain which l hid
in my heart for many days''

481
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,209
''l can't be without telling,
there's fire in my heart''

482
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:48,021
''Most of the ways and
tactics are wasted''

483
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:51,691
''l attend holy mass without a miss''

484
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,506
''l weep without getting sympathy''

485
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,506
''l follow her with no other way out''

486
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:03,373
''Most of the ways and
tactics are wasted''

487
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,210
''l attend holy mass without a miss''

488
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:11,316
''l weep without getting sympathy''

489
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:15,220
''What to say except
that this is Kaliyuga''

490
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,576
Stop there!

491
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,689
-Hey Maju
-What?

492
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:52,592
You keep playing!

493
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,597
lf you'd gotten married in your youth,

494
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,224
you could've played along with
your children now!

495
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,058
Getting married in 8th class?

496
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,600
Were you married at 8th class?

497
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,697
Bro, three glasses of Sarbath, please.

498
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,234
With soda or plain water?

499
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,069
Plain water!

500
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,608
Nothing seems to work out.

501
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,244
There's only one option left.

502
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,079
Go to the Church!

503
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,478
Church!? Don't l've any other work!

504
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,583
l hardly go forthe masses!!

505
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,416
Not the holy mass!
Won't Mary regularly go to the Church?

506
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,690
Propose at Church itself.

507
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,057
You saw her there for the
first time, isn't it?

508
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,394
Wonderful idea!

509
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,062
-ls'nt there no kas kas?
- There's!

510
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,392
What is kas kas for?

511
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,397
Kaskas will make you cool!

512
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:36,403
Church and all that are
fantastic ideas,

513
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,402
but when you go, don't go YOURSELF!!

514
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,404
Not as ME?

515
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,508
Take it, Shambu.

516
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,507
l mean...

517
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,237
-l too want kas kas.
,AiYou also?

518
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,082
Well, l won't be going by myself,
we'll be going together, right?

519
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,577
Go like an innocent studying boy!
Only then it'll work out.

520
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,049
Vinodh, Kaskas is almost over.

521
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,060
What if l write an
English letter and go?

522
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,594
No, is it?

523
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,226
l too want Kaskas.

524
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,599
You too?

525
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,399
No need of Church!

526
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,504
Her dad and mom will be around.

527
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,071
No....no Church...Drop it ..

528
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,299

529
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,676
Dude! l've a superb idea!

530
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:30,693
lf i go to the
bridge... her dad is there!

531
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:31,691
lf l go to the Church...
her dad is there!

532
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,397
Try giving her a call...
her dad is there!

533
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,223
Wherever l go...
her dad is there everywhere.

534
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,229
Dude! An idea!

535
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,712
Why don't we cultivate this at home?

536
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,416
And why can't we take 1 kg
of coca to her house?

537
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:54,915
ls Coco-cola made from this?

538
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,418
No way! Or, is it true?
Coca-cola is made from this?

539
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,222
May be from itsjuice!

540
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,595
Dude! Look here.

541
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:07,594
Will this be fine?

542
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:08,891

543
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,235
Rewind it , please!

544
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:12,398

545
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,234
Watch this now.

546
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,902
Good lord! The Bell over here is ringing.

547
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,539
When l managed to get a cassette finally...
Hell with his ideas!

548
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:21,541
l couldn't even watch it fully.

549
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:22,906
You said your dad will not be coming.

550
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,281
Shall l propose her on bended knee
and say l LOVE YOU?

551
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,916
No..no...you may hurt your hands and legs.

552
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:29,912
Yes, yes.

553
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,258
Shall l suggest another idea?

554
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,726
What if l deliver a dialogue from
the movie Thoovanathumbikal ?

555
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,927
Okay, carry on.

556
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,257
''We shall go to the village
and abode there''

557
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,598
''Over there...''

558
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,926
Oh, it's the dialogue from the movie called
'' Namukku Parkan Mundirithopukal''

559
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,435
Oh sorry! lt's ''Namukku
Parkan Mundirithopukal''

560

'' We shall go to the village

561
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,274
''Over there, grape vine
will be blossomed''

562
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,277
No....Not this..no need of all this.

563
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,440
Dude!! Tell......tell it in a simple way.

564
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:57,748
Shall l say it simple
straight and serious?

565
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,416
Mary, l love you.

566
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,418
And she will respond, ''George,
l don't love you''

567
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,621
ls this the serious tone?

568
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,516
No need of all this...
just tell it in a very simple way.

569
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,727
Shall l tell it in a simple way?

570
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:11,258
Mary, l love you.

571
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,427
Think it over and let me know.
l'm telling this from the deepest of my heart.

572
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,429
Enough...this will do.
Won't this be enough?

573
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,736
She's coming.

574
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:35,714
George?

575
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,284
Yes,
George!

576
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:38,622
He's also George!

577
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,719
Are you also George?

578
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:41,519
Yes!

579
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,920
-What do you do?
- Studying for Pre degree!

580
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,626
Oh...Pre degree! Holy Spirit!

581
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,428
Okay, l'm in SBOA!

582
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,632
Oh! You work in a Bank!

583
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:50,630

584
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,269
No...School!

585
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,638
Oh!! School?! Ok!

586
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,736
Actually, l was waiting to meet you.

587
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,635
Yes!

588
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,274
You'd made a phone call to
my house that day, right?

589
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,273
l think Papa trusts you a lot!

590
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,707
And as there's Caller ld at home,

591
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,283
he will not be able to call
my home from Ernakulam!

592
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:15,248
Will any of you help him
to make a phone call from any of your places?

593
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,258
Oh no...People are always
around in my house.

594
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,427
l don't think it's possible.

595
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,633
lt's betterto opt for
some other option.

596
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:27,930
George?

597
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,432
lt's OK.. Doesn't matter.

598
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,265
Come again?

599
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:33,936

600
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:34,937
You really mean it?

601
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,940
No, if it's trouble...

602
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,444
Not at all.

603
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,910
Thank you so much, George.

604
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,080
l always tell Mary..

605
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,919
that her dad's name is George,
and my name is also George

606
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,423
After marriage, there won't
be any need to change her surname!

607
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,723
Okay, see you then.

608
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,432
Shall l leave then... Bye,

609
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:58,736
Why did you agree?

610
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,434
Who asked you to agree?

611
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:01,935
You loser!!

612

Good Lord! Why is he going there again?

664
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,983
When l passed 10th grade,
it was a great celebration at home.

Now, it looks like a mourning home!

such a big problem?

Hmm...Now only l realized it.

668
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,296
Those fellows have passed in all exams,

except us..

670
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,666
Why do guys think we alone failed?

671
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:57,808
We should have studied something.

672
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,306
As we'd grown up like buffalos,
nobody lashed us at home.

673
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:04,303
What a shame!

674
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:08,978
Hereafter we have to reform ourselves!

675
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,652
What a pity!

676
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,156
Continuing in this way is not good.

677
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,328
Prayer call! l'm going to the mosque!

678
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,658

00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,154
Sir, to fall in love it
just takes one second.

888
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:12,584
l loved her at the first sight itself.

889
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,155
Did l know that she is a teacher?

890
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,529
What if she is a collector or a teacher?.
l don't care!

891
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,768
Then, job?

892
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,165
After this course, l'll look out
for a job in the Sutherlands.

893
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:24,003
l'll be paid a handsome pay.

894
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,840
then, my family...

895
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,699
My dad is an open minded person.

896
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,508
He'll understand.

897
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,706
-And mom, she may also agree.
-They might agree too.

898
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:33,679
What are you going to tell her, sir?.

899
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:34,884
Tell me, let me also hear.

900
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:35,913
Come on, let me hear

901
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:36,743
Do l've to say it out here?

902
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,645
Yes, sir.

903
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,088
-Sir, are you going to say?
- Yes!

904
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:41,853
Then say!

905
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:47,554
l love you.

906
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:50,557
Get lost man!

907
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,163
lf at all, there's any problem,

908
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,697
after seeing a little baby,
everything will be fine.

909
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,129
-Really pathetic, sir!! ,Ails it?

910
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,765
Dude, this morning
we saw the teacher..

911
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,670
We went to her class
and she threw us out.

912
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,579
- ln such a short time...
-How are you...?

913
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,510
To whom am l saying this!

914
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,520
Dude, this morning we saw the teacher..

915
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:14,584
We went to her class
and she threw us out.

916
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,452
ln such a short time,
you thought of all this??

917
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,086
Let's not use the word TEACHER

918
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,825
l feel lot of distance with her!!

919
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:22,031
Why can't we call her informally?

920
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:22,927
-HER!!SHE!!...
-Wait

921
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,698
Won't this SHE be older than him?

922
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,698
Dude, Sachin married a
woman elder to him, right?

923
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,870
But the only difference is,
that is SACHlN and here, it is HlM.

924
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,041
That's what l also said.

925
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,181
Then.... she has pimples.

926
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:41,875
What's wrong with that?
All of us have had pimples, right!

927
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,520
Pimples is not at all problem, dude!

928
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,583
That's not an issue, but surely the
other thing would be a problem .

929
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:47,017
Other thing? What?

930
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:48,816
-Different country....
-Country?

931
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:50,750
No...District..

932
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:52,820
l mean different State

933
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:55,824
So what? All of us are lndians!!

934
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:57,966
- l want to buy some Tamil CDs
- What for?

935
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,164
So, that l can learn some Tamil!

936
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,163
(Malayalam film dialogue)

937
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,574
You'll mess up everything.

938
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,113
Dude, say sorry!!

939
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,675
Me? Never!!

940
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:16,613
We'll be in trouble for internal exam then.
Mind you!!

941
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,014
Jerry sir and all are like that.
What if miss is also the same

942
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:21,950
Bro, we have to say sorry before
madam complains about us.

943
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,856
Even otherwise, just imagine,
if the Principal learns about this..

944
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,127
Remember, you already
have two suspensions.

945
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:27,662
You guys also have suspensions, right?

946
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:28,556
But you have more than us.

947
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,629
She will have a good impression
only if you say sorry.

948
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,597
Otherwise just think about it. We will be
considered as drunken mischief students.

949
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,845
Who is he? Bheeman Raghu (Actor)
ln Spadikam (Malayalam film )

950
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,017
l'll do one thing.

951
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,680
l'll get her number and
call her tonight.

952
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,946
lmpossible! All that won't work out.

953
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:55,556
-Don't even think of getting her number!
- Why is that?

954
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:56,681
lmpossible

955
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:57,955
Sir, you come..

956
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:03,893
Come!

957
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,030
Er....Sir...come.

958
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:08,699
Sir, You come here

959
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:09,836
Sir, it's not necessary now..

960
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,005
Sir you need to do it now

961
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,010
Sir, you can do it! Come on, sir.

962
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:27,951
-Hi! - Hi

963
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,590

00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,701
Ahh!! 98941 ..

00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:40,164
One second please.

968
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,701
What the hell is happening here?

969
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:44,202
Say! Say!

970
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,604
7651

971
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,613
Thanks! Study well, okay!

972
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,184
Uh..how come you guys in class?

973
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,942
-Why are we here for?.
-No, we've a doubt!!

974
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:00,780
Sir...got it..

975
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,250
Actually, last number was 6...
l gave it wrong.

976
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:05,193
And you guys?

977
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,419
You guys wanted to tell me
something, right?

978
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,298
Ah....that's...actually..

979
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:10,198
We're sorry.

980
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,060
-Sorry...-Sorry.

981
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,768
Please don't complain to the Principal.

982
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,700
Let me think it over and say.

983
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,266
l'll think about it.

984
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:26,772
Let's go....

985
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:27,378
Let's go...

986
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,048
Super she is!!

987
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:31,744
You come here.

988
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:32,779
Not enough, right??

989
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:40,889
Simple!

990
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,762
Java is very simple.

991
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,200
And also Powerful.

992
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,991
Very powerful.

993
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:47,794
Then safe too!

994
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,865
Java is very safe.

995
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,067
Are you able to understand anything?

996
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,068
Anjali, are you able to
follow what l'm saying?

997
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,905

998
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,743
l'm telling it to all of you..

999
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,009
lf your not able to follow,
do ask me.

1000
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,386
-Then comes Robust!
-You mean Robusta banana!

1001
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:05,443
lt's not the banana!

1002
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:08,849
Robust means..

1003
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,128
lt's explained on the page.

1004
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:19,025
Refer your text book after some time.
- Sir

1005
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:20,458
Get in..Get in please

1006
00:57:22,238 --> 00:57:23,000
Has this fellow started
his class early today?!!

1007
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,134
l was teaching Java.

1008
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:25,304
Java is very easy to learn.

1009
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,469
So, you will be able to
follow it very easily.

1010
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:31,703
What we were talking about was
properties of Java,

1011
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,710
lt's simple and powerful.

1012
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:37,186
Did you understand?
lt's also safe

1013
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:38,846
Got scared?!

1014
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:40,814
Shucks!

1015
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:42,457
What are you doing?

1016
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:44,784
l didn't see you yesterday.

1017
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:45,858
l was there.

1018
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,990
Really! l didn't see you!

1019
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:49,722
l saw.

1020
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:58,832
MAVA...

1021
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,875
Sir, lt's not MAVA but JAVA

1022
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,041
Sorry..sorry...JAVA

1023
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,186
The next topic is lnheri...

1024
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:17,484
lnheritance!

1025
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,058
Take 25th page in your textbook

1026
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,159
No textbook.

1027
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,194
ln that, you can see a cat
peeping out from the window,

1028
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,162
and the dog eating meat outside!

1029
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:26,901
Look

1030
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,831
Were you able to understand?

1031
00:58:31,975 --> 00:58:33,203
l've also not understood it correctly.

1032
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,035
Let's jump to the next topic.

1033
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,072
Overriding! What's overriding?
Tell me.

1034
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,077
l think he knows nothing
about this subject!

1035
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,505
What's meant by overriding?
Tell me.

1036
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,148
Somebody answer!

1037
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,312
George, Koya, Shambu and Suresh

1038
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,550
Principal wants to meet you.

1039
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,488
Sir, the Principal has called
you too to his cabin.

1040
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,556
lf your son goes this way,
then the situation would get worse.

1041
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,492
Regarding the explosion incident
l actually wanted to dismiss him.

1042
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:03,802
And, then l changed it to 2 months
Suspension only based on your promise!

1043
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:06,064
Last day, he missed his phone
in the Canteen.

1044
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:07,807
Concerned people handed
overthe phone to me.

1045
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:09,237
When l looked at his
phone's Wallpaper,

1046
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,275
lt read ''GET LOST YOU DOG''

1047
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,911
Doesn't your son have any culture?

1048
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:15,074
A couple of days back,
for consuming alcohol in class,

1049
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,611
Malar teacher threw him
out of the class.

1050
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:18,481
But teacher didn't tell me!

1051
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:19,879
Forthat, she'll be taken to task later!

1052
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:23,419
ln fact, this was informed
to me by a student's mother!

1053
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,158
She asked whether her daughter's
classmates were drunkards?

1054
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,430
Honestly speaking,
l felt my skin peeling!

1055
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,429
See, look at him. When l'm
discussing something seriously,

1056
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:34,102
look at the way he giggles!

1057
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:37,166
What nonsense is this!! Laughing?

1058
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:40,040
Here on, lf l ever see you
laughing for any jokes..

1059
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:40,970
Heard me..?

1060
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,436
And regarding the blast incident....

1061
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,478
lt hasn't been proved in
my son's name, right!!

1062
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,914
So, just don't try
to pin up that blame on my son!

1063
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,447
Passover that credit to somebody else.

1064
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,078
And you were complaining about
some Dog or Cat...on his mobile..

1065
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,218
Sir, Those are the words
in the dictionary.

1066
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,220
These words are not
unparliamentary, right?

1067
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,159
And consumption of alcohol..

1068
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:00,360
l too don't like it.

1069
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:05,090
Son, hereafter, don't enter class
after consuming alcohol.

1070
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:08,234
And lf you want to,
drink at home or in a bar.

1071
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,436
What sort of a dad are you?

1072
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,106
Are you encouraging your son to drink?

1073
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,469
We normally don't create
any nuisance publicly after drinking.

1074
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,166
And l've said that to him too.

1075
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:19,106
And if you ever call me complaining
about Dog...cat and all...

1076
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,212
then, you'll see my true nature.

1077
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,219
Aren't we sending our children here,

1078
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,921
trusting them in the hands of
such extraordinary men??

1079
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,548
Can't they reform our
children if they wished??

1080
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,484
Don't you bloody try to trouble me
ever again for such petty flimsy issues!

1081
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:35,662
Awesome!

1082
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,032
Malar, please take care of Mr.George.

1083
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,963
Ah! Let it be like that

1084
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:43,033
George, come.

1085
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,415
Does anyone set a Wallpaper as
''Get lost you Dog''

1086
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:56,218
lt was not me,
that was Bolt who did it!

1087
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:59,215
Oh, l see! l too thought
you've become so cheap!

1088
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:02,716
And l really disliked the way
yourfoolish Principal complained about you.

1089
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,692
-That's why l punched him with my words
-That's Good!!

1090
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,618
And your last English dialogue...
You really killed it!

1091
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,204
Come...Come..

1092
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:22,676
She hasn't noticed...

1093
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:25,478
Today, l'll listen in class properly.

1094
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,749
Now, who can give me
the definition of a system?

1095
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:30,381
Please stand up.

1096
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,087
Who?

1097
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:33,346
When did you three come into class?

1098
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:34,453
Are you happy now?

1099
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,587
You three in the last bench!

1100
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,094
Shucks, this bench doesn't even
allow us to sit. Very unlucky bench

1101
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,755
Please get out of the class.

1102
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:41,595
Let's go and eat Banana roast!

1103
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,566
3 lime and 3 banana roast!

1104
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,192
One with extra sugar!

1105
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:47,102
Ok Sure

1106
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,472
O God!

1107
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,104
What happened?

1108
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,273
She threw us out of class
because we were late, right!

1109
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:00,638
Ugh!!

1110
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,084
Oh! Should have come
earlier if you wanted!

1111
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,087
So, now you're on her side!!

1112
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:08,521
Miss, l've a doubt.

1113
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:09,753
Dude! What you doing?

1114
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:11,354
Go inside and look!!

1115
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,261
Stop messing around.
Class is going on.

1116
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,188
-What the hell is he doing
- Shh! Shut up.

1117
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,097
Whoo!

1118
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,599
l'll howl if l want to! Be decent.

1119
01:02:25,641 --> 01:02:26,767
What's this like school children...!

1120
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,437
Thrown out of the class!

1121
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:32,011
Guys, your teacher is a superfigure!!

1122
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,621
Mother , Father, Guru, and God, isn't
it that way!

1123
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:49,764
Go..

1124
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,445
Mother, Father, Guru and God!!
You hit him for that huh?

1125
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,209
Oh!! Come on!! Don't giggle like a kid!!
Stop blushing.

1126
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,384
See, this is what l hate!

1127
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,754
So what! Let him look.

1128
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:29,795
So you come to my class on time!

1129
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,297
-Okay?-Okay

1130
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:34,268
Now, you can go to class..
and you stay here.

1131
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:35,143
Me?

1132
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:35,867
Yeah, you!

1133
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:37,141
You can go to the class.

1134
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:37,835
Yeah, you can go to the classes!

1135
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,614
Going in the wrong direction

1136
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:46,377
Sir, Why is he...

1137
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:47,452
Sir, don't worry. Come

1138
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,352
You move

1139
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,492
Malar miss! l messaged you yesterday.

1140
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,391
l waited for so long.

1141
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,124
No message came back.

1142
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:06,639
So l called you back,
an old woman took the phone.

1143
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,374
l just cut the phone. l got scared

1144
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,737
Okay, that was my warden.

1145
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,774
She read the message
and said you sounded like a flirt!

1146
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:17,111
Flirt?!

1147
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:19,217
Flirt means?

1148
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:20,383
Rooster!!

1149
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,256
Hi Malar! How is George?

1150
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,290
He's good, sir.
But a little late for class.

1151
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:33,398
l'll take care of him.

1152
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:36,496
l didn't expect this from these people.

1153
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:38,136
Great effort!!

1154
01:04:38,407 --> 01:04:40,500
l never expected that
you would reform them so much!

1155
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:41,209
Thank you, sir.

1156
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:42,936
Sir, did you really mean it
or were you mocking us?

1157
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,209
What do you think?

1158
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,910
-Felt like you mocked us-
Sir, l'm going to class!

1159
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:49,614
A good improvement!

1160
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:50,410
Carry on!

1161
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:51,945
We're going, sir.

1162
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:52,820
Thank you, sir!

1163
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,184
George, this evening, at the ground....

1164
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,415
Don't come...okay.

See... See that dude!!

1169
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,382
Can you see her?

1170
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:54,949
''You walk around talking like a
Cute little girl, my beauty''

1171
01:05:56,352 --> 01:06:02,916
''You walk around talking like a
Cute little girl, my beauty''

1172
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,435
''What ecstasy her cheeks , eyelids

1173
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:25,806
and smile are altogether giving me.''

1174
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:33,889
''Why did a thousand
lightnings strike me''

1175
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,920
''What this love is doing to me''

1176
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:44,355
''Truth and lie seem the same''

1177
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:48,003
''Like a new rhythm in my heart,''

1178
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,305
''Shall l love you forever.''

1179
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:14,819
''You walk around talking like a
Cute little girl, my beauty''

1180
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:22,865
''You walk around talking like a
Cute little girl, my beauty''

1181
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:27,669
-Did she send this?
- l first messaged her.

1182
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,002
And, then she replied back.

1183
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:31,111
You naughty little!!

1184
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:36,942
''Oh Love, it is me your lover
writing this affectionate letter''

1185
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:41,383
''Oh Love, it is me your lover
writing this affectionate letter''

1186
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:42,817
lf l call Nigil,
will l be able to recharge?

1187
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:46,760
''When l think of you, poems overflow''

1188
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:50,659
''When l am going to write,
l can't find the words''

1189
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,336
''Oh Love, it is me your lover
writing this affectionate letter''

1190
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,102
What is this? Market?

1191
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:57,103
Please sit down.

1192
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:03,406
You didn't order anything?

1193
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:05,437
We did.

1194
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:09,544
No problem, you can order

1195
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,084
-Shall l order anything?

For me, one rice cake and banana.

-Vimal Sir: Sir, you don't want anything?

1200
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,087
One boiled banana for sir.

1201
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:20,861
Boiled?

1202
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:22,129
Two numbers.

1203
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,663
My mother is looking for a
good alliance for me.

1204
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,528
Oh! l see!! Really good!

1205
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,670
But l found my dream girl!

1206
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:37,611
Wow!! Fantastic!!

1207
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:44,983
But l've not yet expressed
my wish to Miss.

1208
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,421
-Miss?
-Miss?

1209
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,147

That new Tha...

1211
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,659
That new Tamil teacher only!

1212
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,389
Sir, won't there be
any issue in yourfamily?

1213
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,465
For that, he has to first tell it to Teacher
and then worry about home, right?

1214
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:01,533
Enough, right?

1215
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,499
George, you must help me.

1216
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:10,577
You'll talk high about me
to the teacher.

1217
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,147
-Right, sir?
- Yes

1218
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,046

-..and he has lots of money.
-Oh ok !

1220
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:20,646
Sir, tell about sports...

1221
01:09:21,223 --> 01:09:24,158
Yes, Vimal sir is a good sprinter,
good jumper

1222
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,425
-Good singer..
- Sir, that's not needed.

1223
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,093
-No need to say that?
,AiNo, that'll be pathetic!

1224
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,532
Then you guys can mention about my dance...
that l'm a good dancer.

1225
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,030
l'll say about dance!

1226
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:32,825
No, that l'll tell..

1227
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:34,725
then, l'll tell about your running!

1228
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,531
l think l missed out on something...

1229
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:39,465
Banana hasn't come yet.

1230
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,541
Ah!! Yes! You can also say Vimal sir
owns lot of land in Tamil Nadu.

1231
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,003
Sir, then Kodaikanal is enough!

1232
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:46,907
That's teacher's hometown.

-Say around 20 - 30 acres

1242
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,044
-900 acres?!
-Sir, you can surely say that figure!

1243
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,711
Saying 900 acres is much better

1244
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:18,971
-Really? -Why not! Anyways,
we're simply saying right?

1245
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,547
By the way, ln 900 acres....

Saji, get everything ready fast.

1292
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,776
lt was really a deceit!

1293
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,047
Now, l must look out for Shilpa.

1294
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,216
Would you share a half plate
of Chicken biriyani, if l order?

1295
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:10,717
Who's this Shilpa?

1296
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:11,886
Have l not told you?

1297
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:15,720
Anything will happen over the phone!

1298
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:16,856
Note down the number.

1299
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,157

01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,762
Sir, can you order a plate of
Pearlspot fry...eh...l mean Seer fry

1305
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:41,942
Sir, do you know what my problem is?

1306
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:43,385
Superb pickle!

1308
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,386
Sir, it's good you don't have hair!

1309
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:49,389
You look handsome this way.

1310
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:53,027
lf you'd had hair,
then you wouldn't have looked good.

1311
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:53,887
This really suits you!

1312
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,399
Sir, l..

1313
01:13:58,834 --> 01:13:59,926
What? Want to fly?

1314
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,394
Why don't l set up a wig
like the one film stars keep?

1315
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,001
lf you keep a wig,

1316
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,042
it will look like a lightening struck crow,

1317
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,713
run over by a lorry and made dry...
kept on the head!

1318
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,713
-No need of all that!
- lt will look really pathetic!

1319
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,818
Sir, you first eat well and become healthy.

1320
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:18,711
Anyhow, you can't match
up to his glamour and looks..

1321
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:19,885
At least you can match up with your health.

1322
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,383
Let us eat fish first and then decide.

1323
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:22,121
Okay?

1324
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:23,785
Enough?

1325
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:27,527
Wow!!

1326
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:28,892
Oh my God! Rice?!

1327
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:29,529
Sir, will you say?

1328
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:30,330
What to say?

1329
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,225
Seerfish fry has been served
and rice is over.

1330
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,394
Lonappan will tease me
if l ask for more rice.

1331
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:35,998
Sir, you say!

1332
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,876
-Lonappan-Yes, sir!

1333
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:43,203
He needs some more rice.

1334
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,204
Saji, serve some rice for Shivan sir!

1335
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:49,210
-Fish fry! Do you want?
-l don't need anything

1336
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,180
Do you need anything else?

1337
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,181
Are you a Tamilian?

1338
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,221
You know Liberty theatre in Kodambakkam,

1339
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:55,045
Yes, l know..

1340
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,884
l worked at a tea stall opposite to it.

1341
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,560
That's what l was wondering
how you spoke Tamil so fluently.

1342
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,323
l worked there for almost 3 yrs.

1343
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,395
Oh, okay!!

1344
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,233
Which place do you belong to?

1345
01:15:07,603 --> 01:15:09,901
l'm also from Kodaikanal,
next to Malar miss's house.

1346
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,900
Oh! Malar miss's friend?

1347
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:13,799
No! l'm her cousin.

1348
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:21,047
Sir, he might be her lover, isn't it?

1349
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,541
No, might be her brother?

1350
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,053
See..their ears look alike.

1351
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,111
Yes!

1352
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,387
ln appearance too..right?

1353
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:34,790
MAAVA...MAAVA...

1354
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:35,893
lt's time for you to leave, sir!

1355
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:41,335
Have no penny in hand....
have no penny in hand..

1356
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,232
Arivazhagan!! What handsome looks he's got!

1357
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,402
Really a charming guy!

1358
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,566
Yeah!! Good physique and charming smile!

1359
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,046
l still have a doubt.

1360
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,407
Why do you always have
this never ending doubts?

1361
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,914
You always have doubts on everything

1362
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:57,915
l was talking about the game.

1363
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:58,414
Hey, you got yourself fooled!!!

1364
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,321
Give Rs.10....
- l don't have

1365
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:05,822
He would've left (Arivazhagan)??

1366
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,359
l don't think so?

1367
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,590
Most probably he would stay here.

1368
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:11,556
Dude, is it her?

1369
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:12,998
May be she's calling
to invite you for dinner with them.

1370
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,431
Anyways, we're not coming
and you too can't go, understand?

1371
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:17,571
Don't go, okay?

1372
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,302
Hi George!! What were you doing?

1373
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,412

Dude, what did we eat?

1377
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:32,315
Eh?

1378
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:33,453
She's asking me what l had for dinner?

1379
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:34,314
Tell parotta and beef!

1380
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:40,325
Ah...hmm.. l had parotta and beef.

1381
01:16:40,963 --> 01:16:44,194
You didn't like me introducing
you as my student to Arivu, right?

1382
01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:45,122
Yes!!(Aama )

1383
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:47,332

Yes! Of course you are my student, right?

1386
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,132
Don't get angry, please.

1387
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,604
He left that time itself.

1388
01:16:58,046 --> 01:17:00,913
l was washing my clothes,
hence l didn't pick up the call.

1389
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:01,639
Sorry!

1390
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:04,913

-Rummy! Who said?
-You only told.

1402
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:39,249
You should have the same number

01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,655
l asked in the beginning itself

1404
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:41,418

Oh, sorry! Where do l get Jasmine flowers?

1408
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,029
You will have to go
early morning itself.

1409
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,928
You will get it in the junction.

1410
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:54,429
You'll have to go alone, okay?

1411
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,433
None of us will accompany you.

1412
01:17:58,473 --> 01:17:59,565

One more thing..
When your going, don't go yourself.

1417
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,052
So, you guys are not coming?

1418
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,015
Not that, if three of us set out together,
then police will catch us.

1419
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:17,384
l'm not coming.

1420
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:25,259
This will only work
if you go as a studious-decent person

1421
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:30,097
Dude, She threw him out for
consuming alcohol on the first day itself.

1422
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:30,771
Then, how can he ever
look like a decent fellow?

1423
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:58,393
This is George...My stu..

1424
01:18:58,633 --> 01:18:59,395

This is Malar...sorry Nandini, My roommate.

1426
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:05,704
George, where is your house?

1427
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,039
My house is nearby.

1428
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:08,708
You're a Mosquito?

1429
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,773
My God! l'm getting a call.

1430
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:17,079
Who's this troublesome....!

1431

flute weaved with thrill''

1435

''During the time when l
experienced this cool dream''

1436
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:03,354
''A spring season came to my heart''

1437
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,691
''The peacock couples sleeping
inside me wake up''

1438
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:12,233
''And my inside is filling up with love''

1439
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:15,670
''O beauty,

''lf you are not showing mercy
to come beside me''

1446
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:21,866
''All the beautiful dreams are
going away the beats and rhythms''

1447
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:26,441
''Which l have kept deep inside
my soul tenderly''

1448
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:35,282
''Without anyone's knowledge

1450
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:43,730
''You are raining inside
my broken heart''

1451
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:48,232
''As a romantic rain this beautiful day''

1452
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:52,462
''Flower, my tiring body is waking up''

1453
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:58,407
''Because of your lashing love''

1454
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:04,714
''O beauty''

1455
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:51,729

''During the time when l
experienced this cool dream''

1460
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:24,054
''A spring season came to my heart''

1461
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,491
''The peacock couples

1462
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:32,867
''And my inside is filling up with love''

1463

''O beauty,

''O flower,

You are the rose flower
blossoming inside me''

1467
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:15,881
We can try a simple step first

1468
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:16,573
Please rewind!

1469
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:20,646

1471
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:25,325
Once more, let me wear my shades

1472
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:28,962
Rewind it again.

1473
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,756
lf l don't wear my sunglasses
then my steps would go wrong

1474
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,331
For each dance.... l need a different glass!
That,Aos D'cruz style!

1475
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:36,101
Come on play!

01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:51,682
You must concentrate well and dance

1479

This way..Do it!

What's the problem here?

1503
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:29,181
Where will we find a dance teacher?

1504
01:26:30,051 --> 01:26:32,884
-Dude! l know a dancer

01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:41,458
lt's full of ants inside.

1510
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:47,125
Can't you close it and keep?

1511
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,700
Hello! Are you very busy?

1512
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,273
Ah!! Malayalam?

1513
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,210
Yes ,yes!

1514
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:59,007
Again, Malayalam?

1515
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:01,506
Okay, what are you doing?

1516
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,743
Now...searching for a dance master.

1517
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:10,682
We got one guy!
But he's always over the phone.

1518
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:12,519
Shall l do the Choreography?

1519
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,250
Eh!! You know to dance?

1520
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:16,897
To whom do you think
you are asking this question?

1521
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:19,031
Maybe not upto the mark....

1522
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,598
... l've won some State level prizes!

1523
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,537
Oh! l see!!

1524
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:28,201
What type of dance...
Kuchipudi, Bharatanatyam..?

1525
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:30,939
No..Break dance!

1526
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,104
l think l'll rewind
and see one more time.

1527
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,215
Can you make the steps a
little more easier?

1528
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,047
Sure!

1529
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:18,677
Okay!!

1530
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:36,236
See this, how simple it is !!

1531
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:38,735
No...never.

1532
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,272
Then l will show another one

1533
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:51,214
Keep your hand this way....like this...

1534
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:54,387
How she twists her legs?

1535
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:56,749
Not leg, but hand...See this

1536
01:29:58,092 --> 01:29:59,059
Sir, you know what
l am trying to tell you

1537
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,158
Don't you know any simple steps?

1538
01:30:01,429 --> 01:30:02,396
Like this

1539
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:03,856
Sir, l don't know any simple steps.

1540
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:05,723
Can't l impress her with such steps?

1541
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:06,228
Perhaps possible!!

1542
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:07,399
But l know only difficult steps

1543
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:09,960
Please watch, sir.

1544
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:12,701
lt's not simple...horrible!

1545
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,704
See that... What is that??

1546
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,708
Seeing her do that, those guys
themselves are running away.

1547
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:19,277
Come, let's go sir...

1548
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:22,212
-Paada!!(difficult), right?-Yes

1549
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,782
Certainly! These are quite difficult!
lt's impossible for me to do.

1550
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:26,216
l meant Paada (Sing a song)

1551
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,046
Sir, l think that would be
much better an idea!

1552
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,052
Sing a song or tell a
story what so ever...!

1553
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,884
By just watching this,
we'd break our bones..

1554
01:30:31,092 --> 01:30:31,751
Singing itself is enough

1555
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:25,470
He left! He's not coming anymore.

1556
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:26,142
Who?

1557
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:27,540
Moosa! He left!

1558
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:28,813
Where did he go?

1559
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,381
Who knows?

1560
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:31,210
Didn't he come for the match?

1561
01:31:31,519 --> 01:31:32,008
No.

1562
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:33,754
-Shucks ,AiShucks

1563
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,890
l doubt Justin!
l think he's behind this.

1564
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:39,324
Bloody hell!

1565
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:41,891
What on earth shall we do now?

1566
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:42,994
How are we going to find a substitute?

1567
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:48,334
Hey....l've warned you several
times not to put my t-shirt and roam around.

1568
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:49,997
Fusspot! l'll wash and give.

1569
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,229
Oh com'on!! Have you ever washed it?

1570
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:52,233
When have you washed it?

1571
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,165
l...

1572
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:55,409
Look at this... thread is coming off...

1573
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:56,042
Take it off.

1574
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,040
-l say remove it now
-Ok l'll give you.

1575
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:01,807
You guys always fight for silly things!!

1576
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:03,880
lt is my new T-shirt..
Not even once l've worn it.

1577
01:32:05,419 --> 01:32:06,886
Ergh! Don't sit and drink like that...
Give it to me.

1578
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:09,054
Give some suggestion !!.
We're short of a person.

1579
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:14,052

1754
01:45:14,341 --> 01:45:14,898
What happened?

1755
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:59,304
l am going to Kodaikanal.

1756
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:00,529
What for?

1757
01:48:02,409 --> 01:48:03,808
Arivazhagan had called.

1758
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:06,810
They're getting married.

1759
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:10,813
So, he's inviting us for
the pre-wedding reception....

1760
01:48:11,384 --> 01:48:13,181
You don't have to go to Kodiakanal.

1761
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:17,215
l want to go.

1762
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:19,992
How many times have you gone there?

1763
01:48:20,227 --> 01:48:21,159
l'll go and say..

1764
01:48:22,195 --> 01:48:23,127
What will you say?

1765
01:48:24,464 --> 01:48:25,453
That both of us were in love.

1766
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:28,565
She doesn't even remember your name..

1767
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:29,993
Then, what's the point of telling?

1768
01:48:30,203 --> 01:48:32,194
l don't know all that,
but l must go.

1769
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,200
Even l've felt that
both of you were in love.

1770
01:48:37,444 --> 01:48:39,002
But forthe rest of the world,
you're only a student...

1771
01:48:39,446 --> 01:48:40,378
...and she's yourteacher.

1772
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:42,982
l don't have the necessity
to prove everybody.

1773
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:45,583
Then, how else are you
going to prove your love?

1774
01:48:45,919 --> 01:48:47,784
Apart from Malar,
who else knows about your affair?

1775
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:48,988
Am l to prove infront of everybody .........!

1776
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:52,389
lf you guys were in my position,
would you just booze and sit here?

1777
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:54,457
George!! Why don't you think practically?

1778
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:55,487
Ugh! Practical!

1779
01:48:55,929 --> 01:48:56,827
lt's very easy to advice !

1780
01:48:57,197 --> 01:48:58,164
Be in my shoes and see.

1781
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:00,162
lt's not that we don't
understand your pain..

1782
01:49:00,367 --> 01:49:01,197
We don't mind coming too...

1783
01:49:01,401 --> 01:49:02,163
But what the hell are we supposed
to do after going there?

1784
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:04,496
When you'd been there,
she didn't even remember your name.

1785
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:06,166
Didn't you sit and weep like a kid?

1786
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:06,998
That's enough.

1787
01:49:13,246 --> 01:49:17,580
''Malar (Flower),
in your absence all the colours''

1788
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:22,251
''Which decorated me are fading off'

1789
01:49:22,455 --> 01:49:26,983
''lf you are not showing mercy
to come beside me''

1790
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:31,596
''All the beautiful dreams are going away''

1791
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:41,063
''The beats and rhythms which l have
kept deep inside my soul tenderly''

1792
01:49:41,274 --> 01:49:45,973
''Without anyone's knowledge
are coming out as tunes

1793
01:49:46,613 --> 01:49:50,606
and colours''

1794
01:49:51,284 --> 01:49:55,277
''You are raining inside
my broken heart''

1795
01:49:55,622 --> 01:50:00,059
''As a romantic rain this beautiful day''

1796
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:04,960
''Malar (Flower),
my tiring body is waking up''

1797
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:12,137
''Because of your lashing love.''

1798
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:16,940
''O beauty, ''

1799
01:50:24,351 --> 01:50:37,196
''Malar (Flower), You are the rose flower
blossoming inside me''

Tell me the truth.

2102
02:08:06,378 --> 02:08:07,072
You promised me that you won't drink.

2103
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:08,177
l didn't drink.

2104
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:10,615
Now she's around 22 yrs old.

2105
02:08:13,986 --> 02:08:14,953
22 yrs?

2106
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:17,450
Buddy! Difference of.Eight years!

2107
02:08:17,656 --> 02:08:19,146
So what?

2108
02:08:19,358 --> 02:08:21,451
Fahad and Nazriya...
they have a difference of 12 yrs!

2109
02:08:21,660 --> 02:08:24,458
But that's a bit too much!
That's not right.

2110
02:08:24,663 --> 02:08:26,324
lf that's not right,
then this is also not right.

2111
02:08:27,366 --> 02:08:29,334
-Too bad!
-lf that's bad, then this is also bad.

2112
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:30,464
l don't mind..

2113
02:08:30,669 --> 02:08:33,638
Wait...to fall in love...

2114
02:08:34,006 --> 02:08:34,973
Where did you see her?

2115
02:08:35,507 --> 02:08:36,235
She'd been to the cafv@ one day.

2116
02:08:36,508 --> 02:08:39,477
The moment l saw her,
l got... some spark.

2117
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:43,305
Let it be anything.

2118
02:08:44,349 --> 02:08:46,249
Coming to the cafv@...exchanging cakes...

2119
02:08:46,485 --> 02:08:47,247
Stop all those nonsense!..

2120
02:08:47,486 --> 02:08:49,454
Now you've a job!

2121
02:08:49,822 --> 02:08:50,618
Go to her house and propose.

2122
02:08:50,823 --> 02:08:51,619
No more old style, George!

2123
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:53,617
Deal this with your parents.

2124
02:08:54,193 --> 02:08:55,626
-Parents dealings will be enough
- Yes

2125
02:08:55,828 --> 02:08:57,455
Do you mean l can go ahead and propose?

2126
02:08:57,663 --> 02:09:00,461
Go ahead hopefully.
Deal this with your parents.

2127
02:09:00,666 --> 02:09:01,792
Before dealing with parents,

2128
02:09:02,201 --> 02:09:03,327
Don't l've to tell this to her first?

2129
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:07,328
what if l go and propose her first?

2130
02:09:07,673 --> 02:09:12,133
Go ahead confidently.
Don't take this vagabond along with you.

2131
02:09:12,344 --> 02:09:15,472
and when you go....You go YOURSELF

2132
02:09:15,848 --> 02:09:18,817
Until, now you've been
asking me not to go as myself

2133
02:09:19,184 --> 02:09:19,650
Now, why is this sudden change?

2134
02:09:20,352 --> 02:09:22,786
Earlier you were really a boring person!

2135
02:09:23,288 --> 02:09:25,779
But now, you've changed!
You are simply awesome now!

2136
02:09:26,358 --> 02:09:26,790
Where's the glass?

2137
02:09:27,226 --> 02:09:29,456
Like whom have they asked me to go...??

2138
02:09:39,104 --> 02:09:40,435
-What do you like to have?
- Banana roast?

2139
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:41,765
You'll not get Banana roast here.

2140
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:44,504
-Black tea?
- Just a minute.

2141
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:47,110
One black tea and any cake.

2142
02:09:47,312 --> 02:09:47,641
Ok

2143
02:09:49,281 --> 02:09:51,112
What happened to the
proposal for which you went?

2144
02:09:51,316 --> 02:09:52,283
lt was as usual!

2145
02:09:52,885 --> 02:09:53,351
Hello!!

2146
02:09:54,720 --> 02:09:55,345
Give me a kiss and then let's talk!!

2147

People are around.

02:10:07,432 --> 02:10:09,059
The girl insists on B.Tech!

Where do l get this B.Tech now?

2151

2152
02:10:12,538 --> 02:10:14,062
Don't provoke me!!

2153
02:10:14,273 --> 02:10:15,706
You've to use your brains to
complete such course.

2154
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:17,665
Are you asking a 10th grade
dropout like me such questions?

2155
02:10:18,277 --> 02:10:20,643
Lower your voice, please.
Customers are reading.

2156
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:21,371
Ok. Thank You!

2157
02:10:21,613 --> 02:10:23,376
Keep your voice down,

2159
02:10:26,919 --> 02:10:28,682
-l'll take B.Tech but there's a problem.
-What problem?

2160
02:10:31,156 --> 02:10:32,123
Will l get a 12th grade certificate, then?

2161
02:10:32,624 --> 02:10:33,750
You haven't even passed 12th grade?!!

2162
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:35,684
No, l mean..since my dad
fell from the coconut tree..

Get a degree and then come to me.

2169

Are you married?

2198
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:47,982
Me? No! Why'd you ask?

2199
02:12:49,461 --> 02:12:51,725
Because your wife
can eat real delicious cakes.

2200
02:13:12,451 --> 02:13:14,385
Would you mind if l approach
your parents with a proposal?

2201

Your cake is ready.

Was the cake delicious?

2207
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:53,716
Do you have a pen?

2208
02:14:04,536 --> 02:14:04,934
Are you happily eating it all by yourself?.

2209
02:14:06,138 --> 02:14:07,298
-Boss baked it.-What?

2210
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:08,733
Swallow it and then say,
l can hardly understand.

2211
02:14:08,974 --> 02:14:10,942
Boss baked it..Very delicious one!

2212
02:14:11,143 --> 02:14:11,939
Not much left....this is the last piece!

2213
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:15,371
What's in it?

2214
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:17,104
Nothing. Where is he?

2215
02:14:17,516 --> 02:14:20,041
He's behind there, near the lake

2216
02:14:20,552 --> 02:14:22,315
l think he's a little upset!

2217
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:23,479
What happened?

2218
02:14:24,356 --> 02:14:25,755
Celine had come.

2219
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:28,426
Both were chatting happily.

2220
02:14:28,627 --> 02:14:29,753
Later, l don't know what happened

2221
02:14:29,995 --> 02:14:30,984
He walked out angrily.

2222
02:14:33,131 --> 02:14:36,931
That girl had given a letter.

2223
02:14:39,971 --> 02:14:40,938
What...?

2224
02:14:41,773 --> 02:14:42,705
-What's that on the cover?
-Let me see!

2225
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,806
What is inside the cover?.

-What has she written?
-l'll tell you later.

2228
02:14:51,616 --> 02:14:51,980
l'll tell you later.

2229
02:14:52,784 --> 02:14:54,046
You could have given it to him, is it?

2230
02:14:54,486 --> 02:14:56,545
Will anyone dare
put the head in a running heated oven?

2231
02:14:57,789 --> 02:14:59,120
That's what you've been
doing for these many years.

2232
02:15:00,492 --> 02:15:01,390
Don't disclose him about her letter.

2233
02:15:01,993 --> 02:15:02,755
l won't!

2234
02:15:04,162 --> 02:15:04,685
Hey, George!

2235
02:15:07,799 --> 02:15:08,163
Boss!

2236
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:11,069
Boss! Don't commit suicide!

2237
02:15:11,803 --> 02:15:12,428
Come down.

2238

Please hold me

2240
02:15:18,743 --> 02:15:19,175

Hold him.

2242
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:29,043

02:15:29,421 --> 02:15:30,046
Absinthe!

2244
02:15:30,422 --> 02:15:31,047

Don't slip off and break it!

2251
02:15:52,777 --> 02:15:53,744
Bro, seems like her marriage is fixed.

2252
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:55,171
Hey, get the glasses quickly.

2253
02:16:06,791 --> 02:16:07,223

Some other song.

2260

Then, l've a song
written and composed only by me.

What should l say, Yes or No?

2305

Who's this, buddy?

2341
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:15,701
That's Celine, who was along with Mary.

2342
02:20:17,142 --> 02:20:18,006
This is Celine?

2343
02:20:18,376 --> 02:20:21,106
This is what l've been trying to
make you understand past few days.

2344
02:20:21,312 --> 02:20:22,142
-Yes, this is Celine!
-Oh so this is Celine!

2345
02:20:23,815 --> 02:20:24,679
Hold it up right.

2346
02:20:25,049 --> 02:20:26,209
lt's been two days since l left home!

2347
02:20:27,752 --> 02:20:34,180
''O Moon, do you have a small casket
of mandhara flowers, rubies''

2348
02:20:34,826 --> 02:20:38,318
''Gold, honey and herbal roots ?''

''Are there skylark's songs ?''

2350
02:20:42,434 --> 02:20:48,737
''When waves of ecstasy rise
in the heart, silence sings''

2351
02:20:50,408 --> 02:20:56,779
''When waves of ecstasy rise

''ln the platter of vegetables,
one potato grandma said, ''

2353
02:21:04,022 --> 02:21:07,321
''Little one, have food in the
leaf bowl and swing''.

2354
02:21:07,759 --> 02:21:08,487
Hey, it's not like that.

2355
02:21:10,428 --> 02:21:11,861
See!! This is what happened to me also.

2356
02:21:13,031 --> 02:21:14,328
Pramod! Get me a Scissor! Here!

Baby Cheta(brother), you placed
infant Jesus so early?

2359
02:21:28,346 --> 02:21:29,040
What's wrong?

-What Christian are you! ,AiRC!

l won't be available at 12 ,Ao0 clock.

2363
02:21:33,485 --> 02:21:34,008
l'll go to sleep.

2364
02:21:34,486 --> 02:21:35,453
Mummy has made grape wine!

2365
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:36,149
Really? Ok.

2366
02:21:38,022 --> 02:21:41,287
We'll have a great blast
having wine and bursting crackers!

2367
02:21:41,826 --> 02:21:42,224
Okay!

2368
02:21:42,494 --> 02:21:43,188
Give this to mom.

2369

Happy Christmas!

Come early, otherwise l'll
finish off everything!

2371
02:22:05,316 --> 02:22:06,214
l need a Christmas cake.

2372
02:22:08,019 --> 02:22:08,542
Which one?

2373
02:22:09,587 --> 02:22:10,554

Rectangle!

2377
02:22:14,826 --> 02:22:16,555
No Rectangle...Only round is available.

2378
02:22:16,928 --> 02:22:18,225
Doesn't matter. Will be fine!

2379
02:22:23,535 --> 02:22:24,797
Any dedication?

2380
02:22:25,470 --> 02:22:26,027
No!

2381
02:22:32,176 --> 02:22:33,074
How is your husband?

2382
02:22:34,312 --> 02:22:35,279
Which husband?

2383
02:22:36,514 --> 02:22:38,607
You told about your marriage, then?

2384
02:22:39,517 --> 02:22:41,917
Didn't l ring you up on the
day of my engagement?

2385
02:22:43,488 --> 02:22:45,012
Later, l was totally confused.

2386
02:22:45,957 --> 02:22:47,925
Unable to make any decision,
l was totally mind boggled.

2387
02:22:49,327 --> 02:22:49,986
Then?

2388
02:22:50,595 --> 02:22:51,459
At last, l said YES

2389
02:22:52,330 --> 02:22:52,921
Oh!!

2390
02:22:54,499 --> 02:22:56,296
And thereafter, during the reception....

2391
02:22:56,501 --> 02:22:57,263
lt was a big scene.

2392
02:22:58,469 --> 02:22:59,299
What happened?

2393
02:23:09,080 --> 02:23:09,637
Where did you do your makeup?

2394
02:23:10,515 --> 02:23:11,539
Treesa Aunty!

2395
02:23:17,021 --> 02:23:18,283
Have you been to Bombay?

2396
02:23:19,324 --> 02:23:20,086
Yeah!

2397
02:23:21,526 --> 02:23:23,460
There..at the Red street.....,

2398
02:23:23,661 --> 02:23:24,923
You look like a whore from there!

2399
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:28,658
And it's so horrible looking at you
in front of my family and my friends.

2400
02:23:29,467 --> 02:23:31,230
And how do you think l can tolerate you?

2401
02:23:31,970 --> 02:23:32,561
Hi Celine!

2402
02:23:33,104 --> 02:23:34,969
Hi Rony! l'm Celine's friend

2403
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:36,307
l'm Nelson.

2404
02:23:40,078 --> 02:23:44,481
-Rony brother!! One photo please.
-Take it.

2405
02:23:44,949 --> 02:23:46,314
-Please, look here.
-Not possible

2406
02:23:46,684 --> 02:23:48,083
Will you smile please?

2407
02:23:50,021 --> 02:23:50,953
Please give a pose, Rony bro.

2408
02:23:51,522 --> 02:23:52,454
l said l can't!

2409
02:23:57,061 --> 02:23:58,653
Thus, Pappa called off the marriage.

2410
02:23:59,364 --> 02:24:01,332
You know, there's some stuff he inhales
through his nose at most times.....

2411
02:24:01,699 --> 02:24:02,961
Snuff-Tobacco?

2412
02:24:04,369 --> 02:24:04,960
Not that!

2413
02:24:05,203 --> 02:24:07,171
A stuff inhaled through nose
like the one seen in English movies..

2414
02:24:08,206 --> 02:24:10,174
Oh! Charlie!

2415
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:11,232
Eh!!

2416
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:13,135
Cocaine!

2417
02:24:14,345 --> 02:24:15,175
Yes, that!

2418
02:24:16,047 --> 02:24:18,481
lt seems lf you inhale that,
you can't see anything around,

2419
02:24:20,585 --> 02:24:22,348
and needlessly talk rubbish!

2420
02:24:22,687 --> 02:24:24,018
He still calls me.

2421
02:24:25,056 --> 02:24:26,023
Can't you avoid him, then?

2422
02:24:26,524 --> 02:24:28,014
No point in that.

2423
02:24:28,693 --> 02:24:30,957
He'll call and blow his own trumpet!

2424
02:24:31,696 --> 02:24:33,323
lf l don't attend, there will be
around 40 missed calls.

2425
02:24:34,065 --> 02:24:36,033
Papa said we can lodge a
police complaint.

2426
02:24:36,367 --> 02:24:37,561
But, what can Police do about it?

2427
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:40,367
He really deserves to be bashed up good!

2428
02:24:44,042 --> 02:24:45,066
Here....Look at this! He's calling!

2429
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:46,167
Can l attend?

2430
02:24:47,378 --> 02:24:47,742
Sure!

2431
02:24:51,082 --> 02:24:52,174
-Hello
- Hello!

2432
02:24:55,186 --> 02:24:56,084
Give the phone to Celine!

2433
02:24:58,089 --> 02:24:59,056
My name is George

2434
02:24:59,357 --> 02:25:00,756
George? Who are you?

2435
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:02,457
l'm Celine's..

2436
02:25:03,695 --> 02:25:05,720
Your marriage's been called off, right?

2437
02:25:06,130 --> 02:25:07,563
Then, why do you still
call and disturb her?

2438
02:25:07,765 --> 02:25:08,697
Who the hell are you to ask this?

2439
02:25:09,567 --> 02:25:10,625
Are you her dad?

2440
02:25:11,369 --> 02:25:12,461
Give her the phone, you creep!

2441
02:25:14,505 --> 02:25:15,597
l say, give the phone.

2442
02:25:16,374 --> 02:25:17,204
''Eyes are getting red''

2443
02:25:17,575 --> 02:25:18,337
''Teeth are biting in anger''

2444
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:20,568
''The whole body is sweating''

2445
02:25:24,348 --> 02:25:26,179
''Veins and arteries are pumping up''

2446
02:25:26,517 --> 02:25:28,178
''Muscles are stretching out''

2447
02:25:32,123 --> 02:25:33,613
''Heart is breathing fast''

2448
02:25:34,358 --> 02:25:36,087
in a rhythmic fashion''

2449
02:25:40,064 --> 02:25:42,191
''Hands and legs are shivering''

2450
02:25:42,567 --> 02:25:44,262
''And craving for a fight
The whole body is getting aggressive''

2451
02:25:48,473 --> 02:25:52,170
''And shivering from top to toe''

2453
02:26:16,367 --> 02:26:17,334

GEORGE WEDS CELlNE

2456
02:26:24,709 --> 02:26:25,801
Let me tell all of you one thing.

2457
02:26:26,711 --> 02:26:31,045
This is all fine, but while serving,
serve the guests delightfully,

2458
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:32,475
Or else, things will go haywire,
mind you!

2459
02:26:37,555 --> 02:26:40,683
''lt's a new age,
A brand new world''

2460
02:26:41,225 --> 02:26:44,524
''This world keeps changing
generation to generation''

2461
02:26:45,163 --> 02:26:48,496
''lt's a new age,
A brand new world''

2462
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:52,328
''This world keeps changing
generation to generation''

2463
02:26:52,904 --> 02:26:55,464
l've a doubt for a long time.

2464
02:26:58,109 --> 02:26:59,406
Why are you guys hitting me?

2465
02:27:01,879 --> 02:27:04,109
Will you hike the petrol price, huh?

2466
02:27:05,383 --> 02:27:08,352
''Dark Girl, without seeing you one day''

2467
02:27:08,553 --> 02:27:13,684
''l felt sad and turned into a beetle.''

2468
02:27:14,392 --> 02:27:20,297
''ln my rejoicing heart,
l'm thinking of you sitting alone.''

2469
02:27:21,399 --> 02:27:23,526
''ln my rejoicing heart, ''

2470
02:27:23,734 --> 02:27:27,465
lf l put Bob Marley T-shirt,
you will arrest me...is'nt it?

2471
02:27:28,673 --> 02:27:32,336
''Dark Girl, without seeing you one day''

2472
02:27:32,577 --> 02:27:37,537
''l felt sad and turned into a beetle.''

2473
02:27:39,717 --> 02:27:41,878
Roads are full of Potholes and traffic!

2474
02:27:42,253 --> 02:27:43,345
-Keep your head straight
-Please don't hit me anymore.

2475
02:28:09,814 --> 02:28:11,907
l doubt if there's some misunderstanding.

2476
02:28:13,384 --> 02:28:14,248
Your name?

2477
02:28:14,819 --> 02:28:16,912

Sorry! We've mistaken.

2482

Ah, Yes, l too felt the same!

2483
02:28:27,265 --> 02:28:27,697
Sorry, lt was a mistake!

2484
02:28:30,401 --> 02:28:31,368
Otherwise, how do l connect
with Petrol, Road ..Bob Marley..

2485
02:28:31,569 --> 02:28:32,399
..all were very irrelevant to me.

2486
02:28:32,603 --> 02:28:33,365
Happy Christmas!

2487
02:28:33,804 --> 02:28:35,362

2488
02:28:35,606 --> 02:28:37,574
-Mistakingly... -Bro,

02:28:38,409 --> 02:28:38,898
Sorry bro!

2490
02:28:39,310 --> 02:28:40,277
-Happy Christmas!-Happy Christmas

2491
02:28:41,379 --> 02:28:43,210
Boss! Was it really a
mistake from our side?

2492
02:28:47,919 --> 02:28:50,251
Hello! Why don't you untie me and go?

2493
02:29:45,409 --> 02:29:46,535
Malar, is it?

2494
02:30:03,928 --> 02:30:05,520
-Who invited her?.
- Me only!

2495
02:30:07,398 --> 02:30:07,887
Who told you?

2496
02:30:08,599 --> 02:30:09,361
Celine!

2497
02:30:19,577 --> 02:30:20,373
Does George know about this?

2498
02:30:20,745 --> 02:30:21,074
No.

2499
02:30:56,580 --> 02:30:57,103
You could've told him?

2500
02:30:57,748 --> 02:31:00,080
What for? He is happy now.

2501
02:31:53,437 --> 02:31:55,405
l was pretty sure that
he will marry her only.

2502
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:58,107
But you weren't saying this
forthese many years.

2503
02:32:00,411 --> 02:32:02,845
Do you remember the letter
she sent through Jojo?

2504
02:32:03,414 --> 02:32:04,142
-Written on a tissue paper
-Yes

2505
02:32:04,615 --> 02:32:05,980
Buddy! l read it!

2506
02:32:06,183 --> 02:32:08,378
-lt's completely wrong just like his writing
-Yes!

2507
02:32:08,686 --> 02:32:09,380
Oh, l see!

2508
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:10,951
Then, this is a perfect match!
Correct partner!

2509
02:32:11,956 --> 02:32:12,980
l wonder how would their children be!!

2510
02:32:14,425 --> 02:32:15,153
Nothing!

2511
02:32:23,801 --> 02:32:24,733
What a naughty smile!!

2512
02:32:26,871 --> 02:32:30,204
God unified the flowers
which cannot move with butterflies!

2513
02:32:30,741 --> 02:32:33,539
For you flowers which can move,.....

2514
02:32:33,744 --> 02:32:37,680
.....He bestowed to all of you,
butterflies as the emotion of LOVE !

2515
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:43,516
''The Butterfly is mentally mental,
so is love''

2516
02:35:20,277 --> 02:35:23,178
Mummy has told me not to tell
my name to the strangers

2517
02:35:23,414 --> 02:35:24,881
But l will say.

2518
02:35:25,115 --> 02:35:26,104
My name is Celine.

2519
02:35:26,283 --> 02:35:27,978
Celine! Good!

2520
02:35:29,286 --> 02:35:30,753
Are you in state syllabus or CBSE?

2521
02:35:31,021 --> 02:35:32,579
l don't know.

2522
02:35:34,992 --> 02:35:36,755
Will they both get married?

2523
02:35:38,996 --> 02:35:41,794
God only knows!

2524
02:35:43,934 --> 02:35:46,266
Only God knows who will be marrying me!

2525
02:35:50,274 --> 02:35:50,899
Shall l marry you?

2526
02:35:51,642 --> 02:35:53,610
Won't you find a better girl than me?

2527
02:35:54,278 --> 02:35:55,745
Really?

2528
02:35:58,282 --> 02:36:01,183
-Do you like the ice-cream?
- Hmm, yes!

2529
02:36:01,785 --> 02:36:02,251
Have it.

2530
02:36:04,655 --> 02:36:07,021
Her beehive like hair!! Ugh!

2531
02:36:08,926 --> 02:36:10,689
Get lost, you Chala(Sardine)Mary!
