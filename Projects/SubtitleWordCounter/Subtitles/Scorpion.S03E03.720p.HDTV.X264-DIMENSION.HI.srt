1
00:00:02,425 --> 00:00:04,392
(wind whooshing)

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:08,296
SYLVESTER: Walter? Walter,
can you hear me? Walter?

3
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:09,430
(screams)

4
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,399
Sly, what's happening?

5
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,401
You're 5.5 miles
above the ocean,

6
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,569
falling at roughly
53 meters per second

7
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,271
without a parachute!

8
00:00:17,273 --> 00:00:19,407
Okay, this is where a plan
would be useful.

9
00:00:19,409 --> 00:00:20,975
Please tell me you have one!

10
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:23,844
MALE VOICE (recorded):
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

11
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:29,016
Feel all stress leave your body.

12
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:33,921
Inhale through the feet.

13
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:37,024
Exhale from the crown.

14
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:39,694
A biological impossibility.

15
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:41,996
Doesn't mean it literally.
It's a metaphor.

16
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:45,199
Makes him sound like an idiot.
That's a simile.

17
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:48,769
Cleanse your mind
of all thought.

18
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:50,037
(scoffs) Impossible.

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,706
The brain is
constantly thinking,

20
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:52,807
even during sleep.

21
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:54,875
In fact, a 2013 study found

22
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:57,411
neural activity
in deep-coma subjects.

23
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:59,113
(exhales)

24
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,148
You both said you would
give this a chance.

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,718
We are here
for relaxation.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,353
Sorry.
Sorry.

27
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:08,489
And we will find serenity,
even if it kills us.

28
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,092
(electrical crackling)

29
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,094
MALE VOICE:
Scan your body

30
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:16,797
for all pockets of negativity,
and release it.

31
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:19,633
What's going on?

32
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:21,635
Oh, welding solar panels.

33
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:24,105
I thought we could go a little
green, save a little green.

34
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,206
No, with the Dali-Lame-a's.

35
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,675
Oh, Walt is tense about
Paige dating Tim,

36
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:29,744
Toby's tense about...
Your secret husband?

37
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:31,645
Yeah, and it all
stresses Sly out big time,

38
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:32,813
so hence the hokum.

39
00:01:32,815 --> 00:01:33,948
Don't knock meditation.

40
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,616
Even the marines
are using it these days.

41
00:01:35,618 --> 00:01:37,017
Why don't you pull up
a mat, then?

42
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,019
MALE VOICE:
Inhale white light.

43
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:40,254
(inhales deeply)

44
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:41,989
Pass.

45
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,959
Hold for three seconds.

46
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,994
Exhale black smoke.

47
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:49,697
Three seconds?
That was barely 2.38 seconds.

48
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:51,132
Thought we were supposed
to relax.

49
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:53,868
You're right, uh...
I'm going to reset it.

50
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,636
Okay...
(door opens)

51
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:56,737
Tim, there is no way.

52
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,239
No, I'm telling you,
I think that she is.

53
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,840
Son of a bee sting.

54
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:00,908
PAIGE:
Guys, settle this for us.

55
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,543
Tim swears
the “where's the beef” lady

56
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:03,811
is the same woman as

57
00:02:03,813 --> 00:02:05,579
the “I've fallen,
and I can't get up” lady.

58
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,214
Thank goodness.

59
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,283
I was worried it might be
about something trivial.

60
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:11,419
If I'm wrong,
I gotta buy dinner, so...

61
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:13,387
No, if you're wrong,
you have to cook dinner,

62
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,322
including your
blueberry crumble.

63
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:17,191
This guy can bake.
It's like heaven in a pie tin.

64
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:19,059
Well, I have a project
to work on.

65
00:02:20,029 --> 00:02:22,196
(humming a tune)

66
00:02:25,935 --> 00:02:27,735
This is your urgent project?

67
00:02:28,938 --> 00:02:31,005
Actually, yes, it's...
It's our garage floor plan.

68
00:02:31,007 --> 00:02:32,306
Triple-A.

69
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,308
I assume this has nothing to do
with your car insurance.

70
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,910
It's my “Active
Avoidance Algorithm.”

71
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,778
I track the typical
daily movements of Paige,

72
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,814
indicated here with a “P.”
I assumed.

73
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:42,016
And Tim.
“I”?

74
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,485
Interloper.
Oh.

75
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,086
Anyway, areas where
they typically interact

76
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,189
have exclamation points,

77
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,391
and the numbers
denote duration.

78
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,326
So, for example,
at 2:00 p.m.,

79
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:55,162
Paige and Timothy
congregate in the kitchen

80
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:56,797
for coffee and banal banter

81
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,299
for about eight minutes
and 36 seconds.

82
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,836
Now, from my desk, I would have
an unobstructed view,

83
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,037
and that kind of irks me.

84
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,171
- Kind of?
- Anyway...

85
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:05,539
But thanks to Triple-A,

86
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:07,641
I know to be here,
at the monitor tree,

87
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:09,477
where I occupy myself
with work

88
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:10,711
until they're separated.

89
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:13,948
Now, this map identifies
36 such hot spots.

90
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,017
Hmm. You know, some
world-class behaviorists,

91
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,186
like me, might say
this will drive you crazy

92
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:21,322
if it hasn't already.
Oh, you're one to talk.

93
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,157
You're avoiding
the Happy situation.

94
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,658
Just because I've
stopped hounding her

95
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,160
does not mean I'm avoiding it.

96
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,095
Check this out.

97
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,264
What is this?

98
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,933
That's a dossier
of all my suspects.

99
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:34,902
Any one of these bozos could
be Happy's mystery spouse.

100
00:03:34,904 --> 00:03:35,903
Hold on.

101
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:36,837
Ray?

102
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,806
He was in our lives,
then he left.

103
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,641
Maybe he's
commitment-phobic.

104
00:03:40,643 --> 00:03:43,444
The point is, where you're
avoiding your problems,

105
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:45,646
I'm meeting mine
head-on, Walt.

106
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:48,182
You got the Triple-A,
I'm doing the Triple-H.

107
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:52,720
Hunting Happy's husband.
PAIGE: Hey, guys.

108
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:55,256
Um... hi.

109
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,458
Am I interrupting something?
BOTH: Nope.

110
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,626
Okay, uh, Richard Elia's
downstairs.

111
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:00,194
I think he has a job for us.

112
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,462
Cool.
Cool.

113
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,430
Okay.

114
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:08,669
My company has our first
manned space launch

115
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,237
in three days.

116
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,506
Make a few orbits,
then splash down.

117
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:14,875
Routine stuff, bit it's
make or break for us.

118
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:16,310
We have to meet
this deadline,

119
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,979
or we lose our next
round of funding,

120
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:22,283
and NASA gives our contracts
to Space X or Virgin Galactic.

121
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,551
What do you need
from Scorpion?

122
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:26,186
Well, recognize this?

123
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,089
That's Walter's throttle design.

124
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,925
After you so generously
open-sourced

125
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,359
your rocket research,

126
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:35,095
my guys adapted some of your
best thinking to our bird.

127
00:04:35,097 --> 00:04:37,231
Walt's throttle's revolutionary.
That's what I thought,

128
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,866
but it doesn't work.
SYLVESTER: I can assure you

129
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,834
we have empirical
evidence that it does.

130
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,369
I know that your private
beach launch

131
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,938
last Christmas was successful,

132
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,273
but when we scaled it up
to a much larger rocket,

133
00:04:46,275 --> 00:04:48,375
we found some
instability issues.

134
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,810
Take a look.

135
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,882
Hey, I know you guys
saved Elia's daughter

136
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:56,283
from a cartel last year,

137
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,752
but didn't Walter
also wreck his Ferrari

138
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:00,821
and burn his building
to the ground?

139
00:05:00,823 --> 00:05:02,489
Uh, well, the Ferrari
was one of nine,

140
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,024
so I'm pretty sure
he didn't miss it.

141
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:05,492
And, um, the building
wasn't our fault.

142
00:05:05,494 --> 00:05:06,469
Oh.

143
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:08,296
Although Walter did
hit Elia over the head

144
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,030
with his laptop that day.
Really?

145
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,166
(whispering): I don't put everything
in the case summaries.

146
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:13,534
These numbers can't be right.

147
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,102
You dumb engineers
screwed up.

148
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,737
I'd be happy if you
could prove them wrong.

149
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,205
Walter, time is
of the essence,

150
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,274
and I'm more than willing
to pay a premium.

151
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:27,681
SYLVESTER:
Fuel levels are looking good.

152
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:29,083
You're go for
testing, guys.

153
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,884
HAPPY: No way the problem's
your throttle.

154
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:32,519
I bet it's their valve system.

155
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:34,188
Well, we'll soon find out.

156
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,196
So this contract you're
competing for, what is it?

157
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:43,998
Giving rides to NASA
until they get their own

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,366
manned program
back up and running?

159
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:46,400
It's like “Space Uber”"

160
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:48,469
Our sights are set
a little higher.

161
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,537
Private companies like ours
are the future

162
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,639
of space exploration.

163
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,607
See, we intend
to take the next

164
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:55,643
giant leap for mankind.

165
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,778
Put a man on Mars.
Or a woman.

166
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,913
A whole colony, actually.
And Walter's throttle

167
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:01,015
could play a big part.

168
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,616
That's why I saw the
news van outside.

169
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,151
A little PR for your
company's ego?

170
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:05,886
A little PR never
hurt anybody, Toby.

171
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:07,655
Besides, Scorpion should
get some good press

172
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,056
if Walter can get
everything going.

173
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,858
He'll fix it.
He always does.

174
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,193
WALTER:
Diagnostics complete.

175
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:14,828
Checking the results.

176
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,031
HAPPY:
Told you.

177
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:19,533
Elia, your engineers'
redundant valve system

178
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:20,601
is destroying

179
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:21,969
Walt's throttle ratio.

180
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:23,704
Our experts advised us
to put that in

181
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:25,372
to protect against
standard instability

182
00:06:25,374 --> 00:06:26,607
below 60% of thrust.

183
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:27,875
WALTER:
There won't be the instability,

184
00:06:27,877 --> 00:06:30,144
and I can prove it;
just let me undo what you did

185
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:31,478
and run some tests.

186
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,248
I'll head to Mission Control,
pick up the proper valves.

187
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,550
ELIA: Looks like you guys
are gonna be here for a while.

188
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:37,851
I'll have my assistant
order lunch.

189
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,005
Is Greek okay?

190
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:40,054
Anything's fine.
Thank you.

191
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,890
As long as it has an “A” rating
from the Board of Health.

192
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,591
Understood.

193
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,327
You sure you're okay
with Greek food?

194
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:49,530
Might make you emotional.
Oh, shut up.

195
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,899
We rented an indie
Greek film last night,

196
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:52,948
and I might have cried.

197
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:53,902
Yeah, she tried
to hide it.

198
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:55,536
PAIGE: It was romantic.
I can't help it.

199
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:56,670
True love always
makes me cry.

200
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:57,638
It was one tear.

201
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,673
It was sweet, like you.

202
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:01,208
Yeah, right.

203
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,677
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Intercom off.

204
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,446
Take that. (mutters)

205
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:07,281
You're such a man, Tim.

206
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,183
(muttering)

207
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,719
Sly, what does the radar
look like?

208
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,187
On it.

209
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:16,290
Oh, boy, big storm
coming in.

210
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,058
HAPPY: Rockets are giant
lightning rods.

211
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,827
We better get Walt out
of that tin can.

212
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,495
Hey, Walt, you hear
that weather report?

213
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:23,564
SLY:
Hello? Walter?

214
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,165
You copy, kid?

215
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,467
Walter!

216
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:28,035
Ah, the Triple-A.

217
00:07:28,037 --> 00:07:29,203
What-what does that mean?

218
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,138
That means he took
his comm out.

219
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,273
What about the capsule's radio?

220
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,209
Must have turned that off, too.

221
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,643
Happy, it'd probably
be prudent

222
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,612
for you to go back there
and get him out

223
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:39,613
until this storm clears.

224
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:40,814
Roger that.

225
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:44,618
(thunder rumbling)

226
00:07:46,489 --> 00:07:47,654
(thunder crashing)

227
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,016
(electrical crackling
and sizzling)

228
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,593
(alarm blaring)

229
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:54,628
Oh, boy, oh, boy
oh, boy!

230
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,230
ELIA: What's happening?
The engines fired,

231
00:07:56,232 --> 00:07:57,498
and I can't shut 'em down.

232
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,866
Lightning must have
struck the connections.

233
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:00,033
Did Walter do it
on his end?

234
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,769
SYLVESTER:
<i>Not likely.</i>

235
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:03,337
<i>The fact that they</i>
<i>are firing proves</i>

236
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:05,105
that the lightning struck
the open circuit

237
00:08:05,107 --> 00:08:06,206
that Walter was
working on.

238
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,374
The whole thing got fried.

239
00:08:07,376 --> 00:08:08,876
That sucker is gonna launch.

240
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:10,310
Guys, that sucker's
gonna launch.

241
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,745
Oh, man,
this sucker's gonna launch.

242
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:13,714
There's an escape slide
if he can exit the hatch,

243
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,048
cross the gantry
and get into the bunker.

244
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,817
Wait, does Walter
have time for that?

245
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:18,519
SYLVESTER:
<i>Math is not in his favor.</i>

246
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,053
He needs to make a decision.

247
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:24,124
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
T-minus 25 seconds to launch.

248
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:26,898
He's shutting the hatch.

249
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,730
'Cause if it launches
without it sealed, he's dead.

250
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,497
He's gotta strap in.
When that thing goes up,

251
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:31,532
inertia will pin him down,

252
00:08:31,534 --> 00:08:32,833
make him feel three
times his weight.

253
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,469
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
T-minus 15 seconds.

254
00:08:37,106 --> 00:08:39,807
T-minus ten seconds.

255
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,277
Nine, eight, seven...

256
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,313
T-minus five, four...

257
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,515

260
00:08:55,324 --> 00:08:57,224
Not good.

CABE: <i>We gotta raise Walter</i>
<i>on the radio.</i>

265
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:20,297
He has got bigger problems
than communications

266
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,299
if he wants to survive
the next few minutes.

267
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,234
What problems?
Problem number one:

268
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,502
systems control.

269
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:27,337
The telemetry of the rocket
is a mess.

270
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,872
The lightning strike
scrambled the computers.

271
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:30,207
Lightning struck
<i>Apollo 12</i> during launch.

272
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:32,509
Control came back on
when the astronauts

273
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:34,611
switched to auxiliary
and the computers rebooted.

274
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:35,646
Does Walter know about that?

275
00:09:35,648 --> 00:09:36,647
I sure as hell hope so.

276
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,583
(alarm blaring)

277
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:45,088
(strained grunting)

278
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,590

00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,425
TOBY: <i>And if he gets</i>
<i>the computers restarted,</i>

280
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:50,027
<i>then he can deal with</i>

281
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,429
problem number two,
atmospheric pressure.

282
00:09:52,431 --> 00:09:53,931
If he doesn't
pressurize the cabin

283
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,667
as the capsule gets higher,
his blood will literally boil.

284
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,569
How much time does he have?
Less than a minute.

285
00:09:58,571 --> 00:10:00,604
Button's in the copilot panel,
three seats in that capsule.

286
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,072
Let's hope Walter
jumped in the right one.

287
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:03,807
(alarm blaring)

288
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,946
(grunts)

289
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,986
Can he breathe up there?
Oxygen is involved

290
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:18,322
in pressurizing the cabin
so the systems are connected.

291
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,157
<i>If Walter can get</i>
<i>to that button in time,</i>

292
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,124
<i>he'll have plenty of fresh air.</i>

293
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,659
If not...

294
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,442
Do you have an abort button?
Yes.

295
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,943
And if we abort,

296
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:43,380
Walter's capsule separates
from the rocket,

297
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:45,549
parachutes deploy from there,
and he just...

298
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:47,060
Falls back to earth
safe and sound.

299
00:10:47,084 --> 00:10:47,585
Yes.

300
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:49,786
Then just do it already!
We can't until Walt

301
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:51,221
gets the computers back up.

302
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:52,522
That brings us
to problem number three.

303
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:53,857
What's problem number three?

304
00:10:53,859 --> 00:10:55,292
The abort window's closing.

305
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,560
That's problem three.

306
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:58,829
He has to abort before
the rocket goes into space,

307
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:01,932
and he can't do that until
the rocket's computers reboot.

308
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:03,834
(panting):
I have to abort.

309
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,202
Come on! Come on!

310
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:07,270
(groans)

311
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:10,007
(grunting)

312
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,847
(beeping)

313
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,017
(electronic whirring
and trilling)

314
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:22,352
Walter's computer's back on.
I'm hitting abort!

315
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:25,555
Come on, come on!

316
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,891
(beeping)

317
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:28,859
Oh, no. Oh, no.

318
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:31,328
I can't abort. I can't abort!

319
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,563
Guys, guys!
Don't press the button.

320
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,365
Don't press the button.
(grunts)

321
00:11:36,702 --> 00:11:38,068
(beeping)

322
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,136
No, no, no, no!

323
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:39,812
No!

324
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:41,139
(yells)
What the hell?

325
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,406
Lightning fried
the parachute package.

326
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,908
If we abort the capsule
without a chute, we kill Walter.

327
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:50,080
(beep)
(relieved sigh, then chuckles)

328
00:11:50,082 --> 00:11:52,315
Good work, guys.

329
00:11:52,317 --> 00:11:54,484
Okay, I'm getting data from the
medical sensors in the seats.

330
00:11:54,486 --> 00:11:55,585
Walter's still alive,

331
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:58,188
so we got that going
for us, which is nice.

332
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,489
What happens now,
he just keeps traveling

333
00:11:59,491 --> 00:12:00,691
into outer space forever?

334
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,492
No, the rocket was designed
to blast the capsule

335
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:05,395
into a low-earth orbit
and then stop.

336
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:06,496
Which means?

337
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,098
It means Walter
is reaching space right now.

338
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,201
And the capsule is detaching
as we speak.

339
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,308
<i>But the rocket was only fueled</i>
<i>two thirds to capacity</i>

340
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,876
<i>for the test,</i>
<i>which is not enough</i>

341
00:12:19,878 --> 00:12:21,311
<i>to maintain a stable orbit.</i>

342
00:12:21,313 --> 00:12:23,513
So the capsule is in
a decaying orbit

343
00:12:23,515 --> 00:12:25,515
and will crash
to the earth

344
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,451
in 26 hours.

345
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,087
And he'll die because
the capsule has no parachutes.

346
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:31,421
That's about the size of it.

347
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:33,957
Problem number four,
get Walter home.

348
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,878
How? His ride's busted.
It's not like he can hitchhike.

349
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,095
HAPPY: Not necessarily.

350
00:12:37,096 --> 00:12:38,829
The International Space
Station's escape pod

351
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:39,930
could pick up Walt.

352
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,565
Sly?
Pulling it up now.

353
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:43,500
Won't work. ISS is on
the other side of the Earth.

354
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:44,901
Check out the DOR log.

355
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,303
There's a Russian ISS

356
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:48,138
resupply rocket
launching in a week.

357
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,674
And our capsule conforms to
International Docking Standards.

358
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,576
We convince them
to move up their timeline,

359
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,277
dock with Walter
and bring him back home.

360
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,879
(in Russian accent):
Hey, Vladimir, on way home,

361
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:59,249
please pick up vodka,
borscht and 150-pound Irishman?

362
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:00,851
(normal voice): Are you kidding?
These are Russians.

363
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,886
Why would they change their
schedule to help Uncle Sam?

364
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,321
'Cause then we'd owe 'em one.

365
00:13:04,323 --> 00:13:05,956
You take Paige,

366
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,357
go to the Russian Consulate.

367
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:09,192
Throw Homeland's weight around,
and see what you can get done.

368
00:13:09,194 --> 00:13:11,495
Copy that. Keep us posted.
Absolutely.

369
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,597
Speaking of keeping us posted,

370
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,066
that takes me to problem
number five, communication.

371
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:18,635
Take a look at the damage
done to the rocket.

372
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:20,070
When the rocket ripped
from the tower

373
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:22,205
during blastoff,
a piece of debris

374
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:23,774
must have fallen into
the communication array.

375
00:13:23,776 --> 00:13:26,009
We cannot talk to Walter.

376
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:27,511
What about Walter's comms?

377
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:35,685
(sighing):
Okay.

378
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:41,258
Anyone hear me? Oh...

379
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,093
Of course you can't.
HAPPY: <i>Comms are a no go.</i>

380
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:44,294
The capsule has
radiation shielding,

381
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,729
which blocks the signal.

382
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,497
Well, then, what about
an Air Force AWACS plane?

383
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,833
A big communications bird like
that could more than make up

384
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,835
for the rocket's
communications array.

385
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:53,036
And then they could
relay a signal

386
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,638
from the sky back down
to you guys.

387
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,972
My corporate jet's hangared
here, but it doesn't

388
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:57,854
have the kind of
broadcast equipment you'd need.

389
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:00,844
HAPPY:
I know how we can get it.

390
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,345
Okay, Cabe, I need a hand.

391
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,184
I need your plane gassed up
and pilot-ready in five minutes.

392
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:10,987
A story on advancements
in private sector rocketry

393
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,422
has become a cautionary tale

394
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:14,090
as an unscheduled blastoff

395
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,326
may have launched
a civilian into space.

396
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:18,929
We have been prevented entry
into mission control

397
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:20,764
or an audience with...
(tires screech)

398
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,637
Very subtle, Happy.

399
00:14:28,473 --> 00:14:31,908
(speaking Russian)

400
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,679
My government would be
happy to help.

401
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:37,814
However, in addition to funding

402
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:41,484
and technology from Mr. Elia
to help move up our launch,

403
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,386
we require one thing.

404
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:44,888
Which is what?

405
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,989
Credit.

406
00:14:45,991 --> 00:14:48,725
When this mission is over,
we want your president

407
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,961
to make a statement
telling the world how

408
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:52,896
Russian space program

409
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:54,631
saved an
American Homeland agent.

410
00:14:54,633 --> 00:14:55,504
Yeah, I'm not sure that's
gonna happen...

411
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:56,300
Done.

412
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,301
We need to consult
with Cabe first...

413
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,937
Agent Cabe Gallo gave me
permission to act on his behalf.

414
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,607
Sir, you a have a deal.
Excellent.

415
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:06,042
I will leave you to make
the necessary arrangements.

416
00:15:06,044 --> 00:15:07,777
(clears throat)

417
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:12,983
What was that?

418
00:15:12,985 --> 00:15:16,019
We can't just agree that the
U.S. is gonna kowtow to Russia.

419
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,287
And we both know that Cabe

420
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,688
didn't authorize
you to do anything.

421
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,723
That's right.

422
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,424
So I'm on the hook, not you.

423
00:15:21,426 --> 00:15:23,960
I'd do it for any member
of the team.

424
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:25,762
Now, make the arrangements.

425
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,206
That was Tim.

426
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,407
Looks like I'm gonna
have to make

427
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:38,808
an uncomfortable call
to the White House.

428
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,809
Well, I am ready here.

429
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,645
Okay, guys.
Give it a shot.

430
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:43,213
Okay, connecting to you now.

431
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:44,381
HAPPY:
Signal's hot.

432
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,483
Relaying now.
Ok, Toby,

433
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:50,287
give it a try.
Walter? Walter, do you copy?

434
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,156
Guys... Guys, I hear you.

435
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:54,658
Can you hear me?
We got him.

436
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,192
Yes, Walter, hello.
We can hear you.

437
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:57,294
I'm zooming in.

438
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,663
Walter, Mr. Elia
is very angry,

439
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,031
and he wants
his rocket returned

440
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,499
right now, young man.

441
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,969
I'm gonna return it,
just probably not in one piece.

442
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,137
My parachute is shot,

443
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,205
and my orbit is decaying.

444
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,541
I assume you all
know that already.

445
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:14,678
I figure I've got
25 hours before I crash.

446
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,812
Any ideas?

447
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeah, you're gonna
bum a ride.

448
00:16:17,282 --> 00:16:19,082
A Russian spacecraft
will be coming

449
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:20,717
to pick you up
in plenty of time.

450
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,652
TOBY:
So sit back, relax,

451
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,853
and enjoy your flight.

452
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,722
I could play you
my meditation app.

453
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,190
No, thanks, um...
(clanging)

454
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:29,492
TOBY: Hey, Walt, don't forget
to pick me up one of those

455
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:30,961
“My friend got launched
into space,

456
00:16:30,963 --> 00:16:33,330
and all I got was this
lousy T-shirt” T-shirts.

457
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,165
(clanging)
Do you guys hear that?

458
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:37,767
Hear what?
(clanging continues)

459
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,008
(clanging)

460
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,676
A clang from the hold.

461
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:49,012
No, don't copy
any clanging.

462
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,180
The hold's empty.

463
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:53,083
(banging)

464
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,775
I beg to differ.

465
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:03,244
Why is he opening the hold?
There's no sound coming from it.

466
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:04,713
This could be why.

467
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:07,015
Oxygen tanks must have
taken a hit during launch.

468
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,217
O2 levels are dangerously low.

469
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,318
That doesn't
make any sense.

470
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,386
Warning sensors
should've gone off.

471
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:13,321
Well, not if they
were damaged, too.

472
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,524
Oh, man, that clanging
only exists in his head.

473
00:17:16,526 --> 00:17:17,759
This is bad.

474
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:19,227
How bad?

475
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,662
If he's having false
sound perceptions,

476
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,064
that means he's already
suffering from hypoxia,

477
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:25,133
which means that Cabe
won't have to make

478
00:17:25,135 --> 00:17:26,534
that uncomfortable call
to the White House,

479
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:28,436
'cause Walter doesn't have
a day anymore.

480
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,672
If we don't get him oxygen,
he's dead in 32 minutes!

481
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,173
So how do we know if things
are gonna be getting worse?

482
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:34,376
He'll have full-blown
hallucinations.

483
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:40,715
Oh, hello.

484
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,350
Let me help you out.

485
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:45,920
Hello, Walter.
I've missed you.

486
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:46,921
Guys, why didn't
you tell me

487
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:48,156
that Paige was in
the cargo hold?

488
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:49,824
I think things
just got worse.

489
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:52,894
And that would be
problem number six.

490
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:07,589
Hey, Walter... pal...

491
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:11,226
I need you to sit down,
conserve oxygen

492
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:13,295
and stop talking
to people who aren't there.

493
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:16,198
His O2 levels are dropping
at an alarming rate.

494
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,499
He has less than 28 minutes!

495
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,001
Why doesn't he respond?
He can hear.

496
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:21,437
Sensory cells on his corti
are converting vibrations

497
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,605
into neural messages,
which are carried to his brain.

498
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:25,174
So, yes, technically
he hears you,

499
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:26,475
but he doesn't hear you.

500
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:29,778
Simply put, Walt's taken
a vacation from reality.

501
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:32,214
PAIGE:
Oh, wow.

502
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,450
Oh, the view is so beautiful
from here.

503
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:35,517
It's breathtaking.

504
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,752
I hadn't noticed it.

505
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:39,788
I'm focused on something
much more lovely.

506
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,392
That is so sweet.
Mm.

507
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:44,393
And poetic.

508
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,462
I remember everything
you taught me.

509
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:50,065
My days of not being able to
put it into practice are over.

510
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,600
I can restrain myself

511
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:54,369
when I hear something
factually inaccurate.

512
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:58,740
I can engage in small talk,
no matter how insipid.

513
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,275
I can remember
to compliment someone

514
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,644
when I observe something
about their appearance.

515
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:06,148
For example, you look absolutely
stunning in that outfit.

516
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,516
We really shouldn't
be listening to this.

517
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:08,717
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

518
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:10,085
He's sick.
Da, da, da.

519
00:19:10,087 --> 00:19:11,587
What he's saying
is making me sick.

520
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,588
Making me sick, too.

521
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,623
Thank you.
Mm.

522
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,258
It's what I wore
when we first kissed.

523
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,993
But you know that
because...

524
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:20,529
you think about that kiss
all the time.

525
00:19:20,531 --> 00:19:23,866
What I wore, my perfume.

526
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:26,835
How my lips felt.

527
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:28,637
It's all burned
into your memory.

528
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,639
I have the data stored, yes.

529
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,510
Now, I know you think you know
my limitations--

530
00:19:34,512 --> 00:19:37,045
what I am capable of,

531
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:39,815
or more accurately,
incapable of.

532
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:41,283
But...

533
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,718
I can still surprise you.

534
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,819
Really?

535
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,153
Prove it.

536
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,758

Oh, my.

543
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:21,089
You look stunning
in that dress.

544
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,925
It's what I wore
when you and I danced

545
00:20:22,927 --> 00:20:24,560
at that art fund-raiser
two years ago.

546
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:26,428
I never forgot
how you looked in it.

547
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,496
It's a Halston.

548
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,298
It should be
called a Galaxy.

549
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,700

What was that noise?

557
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:54,056
Just some space debris.

558
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:58,527
Come here.

559
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,295
I didn't know
you could dance.

560
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:02,230
Just body movements

561
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:05,634
and physiology
synched to rhythmic patterns.

562
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:06,868
You know, I am well aware

563
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,738
that with your knowledge
of kinesiology and biology,

564
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,474
you could be as strong as
Tim if you wanted to be.

565
00:21:13,978 --> 00:21:17,579
If I wanted to waste my time
lifting heavy objects

566
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,382
over and over...

567
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:23,051
But you don't
need to do that,

568
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,354
because you're already
lugging around a great,

569
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:27,356
big brain.

570
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:33,195
♪ Just as long as I'm your man ♪

571
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,134
Oh.

572
00:21:42,906 --> 00:21:44,539
If Walter knew
we were seeing this,

573
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,141
he'd choose to remain in space.

574
00:21:46,143 --> 00:21:48,343
You're my whole world.

575
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,746
I'm just a moon
that orbits around you.

576
00:21:51,582 --> 00:21:53,281
That's it. Orbiting moon.

577
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:54,583
That's how we're
gonna save O'Brien.

578
00:21:54,585 --> 00:21:56,318
SYLVESTER: Walter is running
out of oxygen and time.

579
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,057
You need to break it down
quickly.

580
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:58,685
HAPPY: He said “moon.”

581
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:00,022
The moon is just a satellite.

582
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:01,923
Man-made satellites always have
a little bit of fuel

583
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,025
left in their booster rockets.

584
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,127
And they use liquid oxygen
for fuel.

585
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,696
Okay, satellite information
is mostly public information.

586
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:09,331
I just need to find one
that's going to cross paths

587
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,332
with Walt's capsule.

588
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh, I found one. Here.

589
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:13,969
A Norwegian
telecommunications company.

590
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,104
I'm a little confused
how this is all gonna work.

591
00:22:16,106 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm glad you asked, Cabe.

592
00:22:18,342 --> 00:22:20,876
As Walter gets closer
to the satellite,

593
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:22,210
I will hack
said satellite

594
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:24,112
and use its thrusters
to fly it directly

595
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:26,448
into the capsule's cargo hold.

596
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,783
Walter releases
liquid oxygen,

597
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:29,651
and as it warms,
it turns to a gas.

598
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:31,086
He could breathe it in and get
that brain of his working again.

599
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,754
Sounds great,
except for the fact that

600
00:22:32,756 --> 00:22:34,022
I've been watching Walter
dance by himself

601
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:35,223
for the last two minutes.

602
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:37,526
For this to work,
he has to be cognizant enough

603
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,995
to release the cargo hold door,
to get to the satellite.

604
00:22:39,997 --> 00:22:41,029
Walter!

605
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:42,431
Walter, I know you can hear me.

606
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,166
Listen to me, son.

607
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:45,367
It's no use, Cabe.
I'm looking at him.

608
00:22:45,369 --> 00:22:47,135
He's talking to
invisi-Paige.

609
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,970
You can't get
through to him.

610
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:49,938
Whoa. Oh, she can!

611
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,239
What? What'd I... what'd I do?

612
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:54,009
Not “what did you do,”
but what you are about to do.

613
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:55,410
You are about to break

614
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:57,646
the psychotropic grip that
hypoxia has on our Boy Wonder.

615
00:22:57,648 --> 00:22:59,347
Why is he dancing?

616
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:02,250
In layman's terms, he's running
out of oxygen and he's loopy.

617
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:04,086
And the only person
he'll talk to is you,

618
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,488
'cause he thinks that
you're up there with him.

619
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,190
What? Wh-What is he saying?

620
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,161
Things.

621
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:14,629
Oh, boy.

622
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:17,165
Paige, you only have
a few minutes, so talk to him

623
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,334
and get him to pull
that big blue lever

624
00:23:19,336 --> 00:23:21,103
that opens
the exterior hatch

625
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:22,604
so Sly can guide
a satellite inside.

626
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:23,872
What if I can't do it?

627
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:26,108
Then he dies.
But, Paige,

628
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,642
you know how to talk to us.

629
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:29,111
That's why you're on this team.

630
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:31,747
We know you can do this.

631
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,382
Okay, everybody out.

632
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:36,418
Why? What if you
need our help?

633
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,520
This is a private conversation
between me and Walter.

634
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:39,621
Everybody out.

635
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:40,756
Clock's ticking. Let's go.
(claps)

636
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,624
Come on.

637
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,161
You too, Happy.
I can hear you over the mics.

638
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,362
HAPPY:
Damn it.

639
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:49,364
(intercom clicks off)

640
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,668
WALTER:
I have a surprise for you.

641
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,504
Close your eyes.

642
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:56,538
Can I open them now?

643
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,774
Yes.

644
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:01,543
Baked Alaska.

645
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,279
Beats the hell
out of blueberry crumble.

646
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,256
Mmm. Oh.

647
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:15,557
It's perfect.

648
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,926
It's the most scientifically
interesting dessert.

649
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:21,296
Air trapped in small meringue
pockets acts as an insulator,

650
00:24:21,298 --> 00:24:22,564
slowing heat transfer.

651
00:24:22,566 --> 00:24:26,868
So the 450-degree oven
does not melt the ice cream.

652
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,538
Can you show me how to make it?

653
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,539
In the oven

654
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,740
in back of the garage?

655
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,041
We could bake together

656
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,743
and have fun,

657
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,778
but we'd...
we'd have to go home first.

658
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,380
Just us?

659
00:24:38,382 --> 00:24:40,816
Just us, just you and me...

660
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:43,552
...me, but if you want
to go home,

661
00:24:43,554 --> 00:24:45,153
you have to pull the large...

662
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:48,456
...blue lever near the seat.

663
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,825
That will get you home.

664
00:24:49,827 --> 00:24:51,660
Ah, I see
the lever.

665
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:54,162
You're lying right next
to it on the chaise.

666
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:55,597
Um, that's right.
It's right...

667
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,732
...next to me.
Yeah.

668
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,502
(breathing shallowly)

669
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:01,570
Oh,

670
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:03,238
Wal... Walter.

671
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,339
Are you okay?

672
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:05,540
Why don't you...

673
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,708
...sit down next to me?

674
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,611
I'm confused.
Well, I know.

675
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:11,580
It's because you're not getting
enough oxygen.

676
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,114
No, it's 'cause you picked Tim.

677
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,151
I know I can't be what you need.

678
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:18,053
I know I can't be
emotionally present

679
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:19,688
the way that you deserve,

680
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:22,591
but I always thought that...

681
00:25:22,593 --> 00:25:25,293
that eventually,
that you want to...

682
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,362
you want to be with me.

683
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:29,898
And...

684
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,899
that's why it hurts.

685
00:25:30,901 --> 00:25:32,767
Because...

686
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:33,768
(exhales)

687
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,804
...because I love you.

688
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:43,111
I love you, too, Walter.

689
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,882
And we-we can be together.
You just have to...

690
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:50,318
...pull that lever,
and it'll be just you and me.

691
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:54,956
And we'll be together...

692
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:56,124
forever.

693
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,527
I don't see the handle,

694
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,695
I just see your hand.

695
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,565
Well, that's what I meant.
Take my hand.

696
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:04,733
Pull me to you.

697
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:08,403
Do that, and everything
will be okay, Walter.

698
00:26:11,675 --> 00:26:13,008
Now pull me close.

699
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,081
(air rushing)

700
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:22,918
(sighs)

701
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:29,190
The hatch is open.

702
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:30,525
Yes!

703
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:33,628
That's a good job. You okay?

704
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,864
Yeah.

705
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:37,365
Great work in there.

706
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,700
Couldn't have been easy.

707
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:39,901
What'd you have to tell him?

708
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:42,637
Uh, whatever he needed to hear.

709
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:44,539
(sighs)

710
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,441
Okay, I am
into the Norwegian satellite.

711
00:26:46,443 --> 00:26:47,876
Now I just need to manipulate

712
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,411
the thrusters,
and I will be able to

713
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:51,212
guide it through the external
hatch within minutes.

714
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:53,548
Walter opens the interior hatch
and the liquid O2 warms to gas

715
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,617
and he stays alive.
I'm not so sure about that.

716
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,552
He can't open the interior hatch
if he's passed out.

717
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:59,487
And if he doesn't open the hatch...
He doesn't get the oxygen.

718
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:00,722
And if he doesn't get
the oxygen...

719
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:01,756
Then Walter dies.

720
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,391
Walter!

721
00:27:03,393 --> 00:27:05,060
Walter, wake the hell up!

722
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:06,194
Wait, what's going on?

723
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:07,629
He's unconscious!
Let him hear your voice.

724
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:08,697
Walter!

725
00:27:08,699 --> 00:27:09,798
Walter, it's me.
Remember, you promised

726
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,633
to come back
to the garage with me!

727
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:13,201
Walter!
It's no use.

728
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:14,636
He's out.

729
00:27:29,587 --> 00:27:30,686
CABE:
<i>All right,</i>

730
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,787
so if he's out cold,

731
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,222
how we gonna get the oxygen
to him?

732
00:27:33,224 --> 00:27:34,857
We don't.

733
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:36,659
But maybe we can get him
to the oxygen.

734
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:37,960
I don't like
where this is heading.

735
00:27:37,962 --> 00:27:38,928
And where is this heading?

736
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,596
Happy wants me
to use the thrusters

737
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,164
to push the capsule
into the atmosphere,

738
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,833
where he'll be
surrounded by oxygen.

739
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:46,068
But Walter's in the capsule.
How does he get to the oxygen?

740
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,403
See, that's the part
that I don't like.

741
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:48,804
We remotely blow the hatch.

742
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:50,139
The change in pressure
sucks Walter out

743
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,674
into the sky,
where he'll be able to breathe.

744
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:53,342
We covered this
in medical school.

745
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:55,277
Falling thousands of feet
without a parachute,

746
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,046
it's bad for your health.
I'll catch him.

747
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:59,181
Mm, I don't think they make
baseball gloves that big.

748
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:01,250
No, on a SEAL mission,
we once did a HALO jump.

749
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:02,284
One of our guys passed out.

750
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:03,719
He had a bad mix of stuff
in his tank.

751
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,921
I dove after him, I caught him,
I pulled his chute.

752
00:28:05,923 --> 00:28:08,290
If I could catch him,
I can catch Walter.

753
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:09,859
Except I am
backing the satellite

754
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:11,660
into the cargo hold right now,
as we speak.

755
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:12,895
There is no time for you

756
00:28:12,897 --> 00:28:15,097
to get into a plane and get
all the way up there. Plus,

757
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,265
if I don't push this capsule

758
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:17,433
into the atmosphere
within the next...

759
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:18,500
180 seconds.

760
00:28:18,502 --> 00:28:20,469
...180 seconds,
Walter will suffocate!

761
00:28:20,471 --> 00:28:21,537
CABE:
I can do it!

762
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,105
I had jump training
in the Corps,

763
00:28:23,107 --> 00:28:25,307
and this plane is already
chasing after the capsule.

764
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:26,675
It's the only hope he's got.

765
00:28:26,677 --> 00:28:28,978
Elia, you got to have
emergency chutes on this rig.

766
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,279
Back closet, on the top.

767
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,280
All right.

768
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:32,414
Timing has to be perfect.

769
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:33,515
Sly?
Do you have any idea

770
00:28:33,517 --> 00:28:35,384
how many variables
need to be computed

771
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:37,419
in order to make Cabe
and Walter intersect?

772
00:28:37,421 --> 00:28:39,355
No! But you do.
So figure it out!

773
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:41,824
(muttering):
Okay...

774
00:28:41,826 --> 00:28:43,325
Last time you did this?

775
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:44,360
30 years ago.

776
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:46,095
Wow. I'm not even 30.

777
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:47,897
Shut up.
SYLVESTER: Okay, Cabe,

778
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:49,932
I just got your speed
and coordinates from your pilot.

779
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:52,334
Walter's capsule is plummeting
through the atmosphere,

780
00:28:52,336 --> 00:28:53,535
so we got to do this now.

781
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:54,970
How much do you weigh?
200 pounds?

782
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:56,906
207.

783
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:59,508
I start a program on Monday.

784
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,343
Okay, that will
affect calculations.

785
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,145
All right, Cabe,
when I say, “Go,”

786
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:04,213
you need to leap.

787
00:29:04,215 --> 00:29:05,281
Yeah, I got it, kid.

788
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:06,615
SYLVESTER:
Walter's capsule is burning

789
00:29:06,617 --> 00:29:07,783
through the thermosphere.

790
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:09,585
Okay, on my count,
I'm going to tell Cabe

791
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,387
to leap out of a
perfectly good plane

792
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,789
and then eject my friend
into the atmosphere

793
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,957
without a parachute.

794
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,025
Don't worry about me, Sly!

795
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:17,226
You just tell me when!

796
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:18,527
Cabe, now!

797
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:29,305
Okay, seconds away from
launching Walter, but somebody's

798
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:31,507
gonna have to push that button
because I-I can't do it.

799
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,442
I'll do it.
Great.

800
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:36,512
You volunteered for that job
pretty quickly.

801
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:38,881
(button clicks, beeps)

802
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:42,217
All right, genius eject
in three, two, one.

803
00:29:42,219 --> 00:29:43,218
Now.

804
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,386
(beeps)

805
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:48,958
Oh, no!

806
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,326
What do you mean,
“Oh, no”?!

807
00:29:50,328 --> 00:29:51,727
He's out of the capsule.
That's what we wanted.

808
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:53,262
Despite the power that pulled
him out of the capsule,

809
00:29:53,264 --> 00:29:55,064
he was still able to hang
onto the lever longer

810
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,298
than somebody
should've been able to.

811
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,000
He thought it was my hand.

812
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,468
His subconscious tried
to hang onto you.

813
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,337
Given the speed and distance
of what we're dealing with,

814
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,372
one second can mess up
all of my calculations.

815
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,941
Cabe could miss.

816
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:08,444
Walter?!

817
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:09,445
Walter, can you hear me?

818
00:30:09,447 --> 00:30:11,513
Walter!

819
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:12,681
(shouts)

820
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:13,949
Sly, what's happening?!

821
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:15,951
You are 5.5 miles
above the ocean,

822
00:30:15,953 --> 00:30:19,822
falling at roughly 53 meters
per second without a parachute!

823
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:22,157
Okay, this is where a plan
would be useful.

824
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,392
Please tell me you have one.

825
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:25,160
Hold, please.

826
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:27,162
Wh... uh, Sly,
what are you doing?!

827
00:30:27,164 --> 00:30:29,932
He is falling likely to his
death, and Cabe might miss

828
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:32,868
catching him midair in a
one at a one million shot

829
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,303
because he was
hanging onto a lever

830
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:36,405
that he thought
was imaginary Paige!

831
00:30:36,407 --> 00:30:38,340
Would you like me
to tell him that?!

832
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,641
No, it's best you not say that.

833
00:30:39,643 --> 00:30:40,676
HAPPY:
Maybe we can fix

834
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:41,677
Cabe's trajectory

835
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,811
by using physics.

836
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,179
Cabe, spread out your arms,

837
00:30:44,181 --> 00:30:46,982
palms out for a second, let wind
resistance slow you down.

838
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,487
Hope that was enough!

839
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,590
Hey, Walter.
It's Sylvester.

840
00:30:54,592 --> 00:30:55,824
Sly, what the hell?!

841
00:30:55,826 --> 00:30:56,892
I'm sorry you're stressed out,

842
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:58,027
but you got
to do me a favor

843
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,028
and look to your right.

844
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,129
(groans)

845
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:01,930
You see that little dot
coming in hot?

846
00:31:01,932 --> 00:31:03,532
That is Cabe.

847
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:04,533
When he collides with you,

848
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,201
you need to grab
him and hold tight.

849
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:08,637
This will be
a violent collision.

850
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:09,738
It's like snagging
a hard spiral

851
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,773
that's thrown your way.

852
00:31:10,775 --> 00:31:12,408
Okay, just cradle the football.

853
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,209
Don't fight it, or it will
bounce off your hands.

854
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:15,611
I never caught a football!

855
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,846
I think I'm wide
on the approach!

856
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:20,449
Lean in the opposite direction
to counteract the variable.

857
00:31:21,752 --> 00:31:23,452
I'm trying!

858
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:25,487
I can't seem to...

859
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,222
Walter!

860
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:28,223
(groans)

861
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,691
Cabe!

862
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:32,094
Cabe!

863
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,695
Walter!

864
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:35,731
I missed him!
Cabe.

865
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,366
Pull your chute.

866
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,435
Guys, please tell me

867
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:40,936
there's a plan “B.”

868
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,825
Okay. Just got
off the horn

869
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:57,959
with our friend
Admiral Pace.

870
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:58,927
There is a naval sub

871
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,896
on maneuvers in
the immediate area.

872
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:02,497
They've been dispatched
to pick up Cabe and...

873
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:03,632
retrieve Walter.

874
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:05,734
Retrieve? We're not just
gonna let him fall.

875
00:32:05,736 --> 00:32:07,602
Paige, I didn't mean it
like that. It's just...

876
00:32:07,604 --> 00:32:08,937
It's just that
we're out of options.

877
00:32:08,939 --> 00:32:10,072
We're Scorpion.
We're never out of options.

878
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:11,473
There must've
been situations

879
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:13,408
where people have fallen
without a chute and lived.

880
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,810
Exceedingly rare
situations.

881
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:15,911
I'm looping
Walter back in.

882
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:17,179
We need his brain.

883
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,413
Hey, Walter.

884
00:32:18,415 --> 00:32:20,515
It's the gang, but we don't have
a plan “B” yet.

885
00:32:20,517 --> 00:32:21,616
Well, now's a good time
to think of one!

886
00:32:21,618 --> 00:32:22,684
HAPPY:
That's why we're searching

887
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:23,852
for common factors

888
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,921
in parachute fail
survival stories.

889
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,055
I remember a guy
in Kansas

890
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:28,290
hit a plowed field
and lived.

891
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,192
I once read a story about a guy
who crash-landed

892
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:31,426
in the Okefenokee Swamp.

893
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:32,928
PAIGE:
Freshly turned over earth,

894
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,363
swampland...
they hit something soft.

895
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:35,464
Walter's about to hit water.

896
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:36,965
Water's soft.
SYLVESTER: No, no, no.

897
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:39,234
The surface tension of water
doesn't allow for compression.

898
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:41,069
If he hits the water at this
speed, it's like cement.

899
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:42,070
WALTER:
The common factor

900
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:44,606
is aeration.
I need bubbles.

901
00:32:44,608 --> 00:32:46,475
He's right-- swampland
is naturally aerated,

902
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:48,477
so is tilled soil. We just
need to aerate the water.

903
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,045
I was a platform diver
in high school.

904
00:32:50,047 --> 00:32:51,980
Was there a sport
you didn't play?

905
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:54,449
In practice, they softened
the water by using a machine

906
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:55,650
that blew bubbles into the pool.

907
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:57,386
It helped prevent injuries.
That's a pool.

908
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:59,354
We're talking about
the Pacific Ocean.

909
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:00,856
But Walt will just hit
a small area.

910
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:02,157
Sly can calculate
the exact coordinates,

911
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,558
then we'll just need
a big explosion

912
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,794
deep underwater
that is perfectly timed.

913
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:07,729
It'll roil the water,
break the surface tension

914
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,464
and cocoon Walt's body
when he hits.

915
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,233
My odds of survival are low.

916
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:13,468
Your current odds
of survival are zero.

917
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,003
This is our only shot, buddy.

918
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,005
I'm gonna call Admiral
Pace at Naval Command.

919
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:18,407
I'll tell him we'll have
coordinates and launch orders

920
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:20,675
for the rescue sub ASAP.
Launch orders?

921
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:22,310
I'm gonna detonate a torpedo
right under Walter.

922
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:23,211
That will provide

923
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:24,446
Happy
the explosion

924
00:33:24,448 --> 00:33:25,414
that she's looking for.

925
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:27,382
(exclaiming)

926
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:29,317
Man the torpedoes.
We have direct orders

927
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,653
to fire on
Admiral Pace's command.

928
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:34,423
Aye, aye, Admiral.
Fire!

929
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,558
My math has the torpedo

930
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,759
detonating in ten seconds.

931
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:39,961
TOBY: Walt, feet together,
toes pointed,

932
00:33:39,963 --> 00:33:41,396
arms at your side, chin tucked,

933
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:44,566
and try to relax.
Oh, sure, relax. No problem.

934
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:50,205
Five, four, three,

935
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:52,974
two, one.

936
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:09,758
<i>This is XO Calvin</i>
<i>of the USS</i> Grandin.

937
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,827
<i>We have retrieved</i>
<i>Walter O'Brien.</i>

938
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:15,664
He is alive.

939
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:17,466
- Repeat: He is alive.
- Yes! (all cheering)

940
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:20,101
Yes!
(exhales)

941
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:22,537
Yeah!
Come on, man!

942
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,738
Come on!

943
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,006
Aah!
Scorpion!

944
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:27,476
BOTH: Scorpion!

945
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,483
Hey.
Hey.

946
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:35,851
You should be resting.

947
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:38,353
Well, I've been
resting for five days.

948
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:39,721
I'm going stir crazy.

949
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:40,789
Well, too bad.
Now take your pill.

950
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:41,890
I don't like
methylprednisolone.

951
00:34:41,892 --> 00:34:43,758
Uh, it makes me jumpy.

952
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,228
Toby says it keeps inflammation
down around your L4.

953
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,897
L5.
Whatever. Take it.

954
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:55,871
So...

955
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:58,039
how's your head?

956
00:34:58,942 --> 00:35:01,877
It's better.
No more headaches.

957
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:05,514
And, um... the memory loss?

958
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:07,349
Um, well...

959
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:09,017
I remember the fall,

960
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:12,120
the torpedo explosion.

961
00:35:12,122 --> 00:35:14,623
Um... nothing after that

962
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,358
except for waking up
at the hospital.

963
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,193
I meant, uh, up in the capsule.

964
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,262
No memory at all of that,
of what you were

965
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:21,997
thinking or experiencing?

966
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,565
No, nothing.

967
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,567
But that makes sense,
considering the O2 levels.

968
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,168
TOBY (clears throat):
Sorry to interrupt,

969
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,571
but you got a visitor, boss.
Mr. Elia.

970
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:31,439
He's resting.
Nonsense.

971
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:34,276
If I don't move around,
I'm gonna lose my mind.

972
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:37,913
Uh, what were you guys
talking about?

973
00:35:37,915 --> 00:35:39,014
Nothing, just chatting.

974
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,682
Excuse me.
I can help you

975
00:35:40,684 --> 00:35:42,918
downstairs.
He's fine.

976
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,719
Hey.

977
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,954
Yes?

978
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:48,256
Why are you pressing
to see what he remembers?

979
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,191
Uh, I'm worried about his brain.

980
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:53,395
It's Scorpion's... top asset.

981
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,665
Bullpoop. You want to know if he
remembers confessing his love.

982
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,700
Bullpoop. I want to know
if he's okay.

983
00:35:58,702 --> 00:36:00,869
Paige, you've moved on to Tim.

984
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:03,004
Walter is trying
to move on from you,

985
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:05,307
but his subconscious
is struggling with it.

986
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:07,509
You digging up
these memories

987
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:09,844
and messing around with them
is going to hurt him

988
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:11,646
worse than when
he hit that water.

989
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:13,181
Trust me, if he has
any recollection

990
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:16,518
of what went on in that capsule
buried away, it will surface.

991
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,053
There will be clues.

992
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,788
And that's mucho bad.

993
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,590
'Cause that means
he can't get over you,

994
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,925
which means a big pile of chaos

995
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,860
for all of us.

996
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:28,563
Especially the guy
that can't process emotion.

997
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:36,338
Uh, I need to...
clean these dishes.

998
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,213
(grunts)

999
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:46,815
Okay.

1000
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,016
Oh, my God.

1001
00:36:48,018 --> 00:36:49,985
My doctors treating you okay?

1002
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:51,386
Uh, too well.

1003
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:54,656
They visit twice a day
to give cognitive evaluations.

1004
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:56,992
Only twice? I told them
morning, noon and evening.

1005
00:36:56,994 --> 00:36:58,059
You shouldn't feel guilty.

1006
00:36:58,061 --> 00:36:59,294
Lightning strikes
are unpredictable.

1007
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:00,595
I do feel guilty.

1008
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:02,497
I've been reviewing
the footage to try and see

1009
00:37:02,499 --> 00:37:03,798
what could've been done
to prevent it.

1010
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,600
Hm. You find
anything interesting?

1011
00:37:05,602 --> 00:37:07,636
Yes.

1012
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:09,170
But not with respect
to the rocket.

1013
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:10,639
Walter, you had a split second

1014
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:11,773
to decide whether you could

1015
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:13,575
get out of the capsule
before it launched

1016
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,844
or if your best
chance of survival

1017
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:17,912
was to shut the hatch
and ride it out.

1018
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,681
I calculated the odds
and decided

1019
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:21,082
there wasn't time to escape.

1020
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:22,684
Certainly a tough call.

1021
00:37:22,686 --> 00:37:24,953
But in the same situation,
I would have tried to get out.

1022
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:26,287
Almost anyone would have.

1023
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:28,790
Well, you don't have a 197 IQ.

1024
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:31,960
But I'm low 150s.

1025
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:33,561
And I have some life experience.

1026
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:35,563
Point is, Walter...

1027
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,966
I know you and Paige
had some kind of a thing once.

1028
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:39,801
And I also couldn't
help but notice

1029
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:42,203
that she's gotten close
to your newest team member.

1030
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:44,673
Timothy, yeah.
What I'm trying to say is

1031
00:37:44,675 --> 00:37:48,376
guys who think like you and me--

1032
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:50,111
we avoid what we can't solve,

1033
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:53,181
do almost anything to avoid
it, no matter how drastic.

1034
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,884
I've been there,
during my divorce.

1035
00:37:55,886 --> 00:37:57,719
Mm.
Walter, guys like you and me--

1036
00:37:57,721 --> 00:38:00,588
we need to find something to
fill our time constructively,

1037
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:04,192
because next time
you try avoidance...

1038
00:38:05,228 --> 00:38:06,494
(sighs)

1039
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:09,097
...we might not be able
to bring you home.

1040
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,967
Okay?
Okay.

1041
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,436
All right.

1042
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:15,637
Take care, pal.

1043
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:18,173
Okay. You, too.

1044
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:27,649
(Walter grunts)

1045
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:29,517
Hmm. Everyone gone?

1046
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,819
Paige is cleaning up,

1047
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:32,787
Sly's at some
comic book nerd fest,

1048
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:34,756
Happy's at the junkyard,
and I'm busy...

1049
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:36,624
Hunting Happy's husband?
Yup.

1050
00:38:36,626 --> 00:38:38,893
Still think it's a bad idea.
Still don't care what you think.

1051
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:40,628
Fair enough.

1052
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:43,164
(grunts)
I am feeling better,

1053
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,333
so I'm heading to Emma's
for dessert.

1054
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:47,869
Emma's-- isn't that place
famous for baked Alaska?

1056
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:50,872

around in my head.

1058
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:55,877
Okay, see you later.
